This guide walks you through using rei with a realistic example. By the end, you'll understand how rei's primitives work together to support intentional progress over time.

## Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) for the development environment
- Optionally, the `claude` CLI for AI coaching features

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinzui/rei.git
cd rei
nix develop
cabal build all
```

## Starting Services

```bash
just process-up           # Start database
just run-migrations       # Apply database migrations
```

## Example: Becoming a Better Writer

This example follows a real goal: becoming a better writer. It's:

- **Long-lived** — not finished in a sprint
- **Identity-shaping** — about who you become, not just what you produce
- **Habit-driven** — progress comes from consistency, not heroics

### Step 1: Start with Meaning

Rei organizes work by *meaning*, not checklists. Start with the *why*:

```bash
rei intention create "Connect with like-minded people and grow professionally" --context personal
```

This creates your **parent intention**—the deeper purpose.

### Step 2: Create a Child Intention

Now create the intention that serves that meaning:

```bash
rei intention create "Become a better writer" --parent <parent-id>
```

View the hierarchy:

```bash
rei intention tree
```

```
Connect with like-minded people and grow professionally
└── Become a better writer
```

### Step 3: Create a Habit

Writing improves through daily practice. Create a habit:

```bash
rei habit create \
  --name "Daily Writing" \
  --purpose "Build fluency and clarity" \
  --daily \
  --action "Write freely"
```

Link the habit to your intention for context:

```bash
rei habit link-intention <habit-id> <intention-id>
```

### Step 4: Record Your Work

After a writing session, record it:

```bash
rei action record "Wrote morning pages for 20 minutes" --duration 20m
```

### Step 5: Record Outcomes

When something meaningful happens, record the evidence:

```bash
rei outcome record <intention-id> "Published first blog post"
```

### Step 6: Reflect

At the end of the day, reflect on what happened:

```bash
rei reflect today
```

This opens your editor to capture insights about your progress.

### Step 7: Check Your Dashboard

See everything at a glance:

```bash
rei today
```

This shows your active intentions, pending habits, recent actions, and any blockers.
