Administrative commands for system maintenance and data fixes.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `evaluate-dormancy` | Mark inactive intentions as dormant |
| `fix-dormancy` | Fix wrongly dormant intentions |

## Dormancy Overview

Rei automatically tracks intention health and can mark intentions as "dormant" when they've had no activity for a configured threshold (default: 10 days). Dormancy is hierarchy-aware — a parent intention with active children is not considered dormant.

## evaluate-dormancy

Mark inactive intentions as dormant based on the inactivity threshold.

```bash
rei system evaluate-dormancy [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-t, --threshold <days>` — Inactivity threshold in days (default: from config or 10)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use default threshold from config
rei system evaluate-dormancy

# Use custom 30-day threshold
rei system evaluate-dormancy -t 30
```

## fix-dormancy

One-off fix for intentions that were incorrectly marked dormant before hierarchy-aware dormancy evaluation was implemented. This command checks each dormant intention for recent activity in its subtree (descendant intentions) and awakens those with recent descendant activity.

```bash
rei system fix-dormancy [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-t, --threshold <days>` — Inactivity threshold in days (default: from config or 10)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Fix dormant intentions using default threshold
rei system fix-dormancy

# Fix using custom threshold
rei system fix-dormancy -t 14
```

**Example output:**

```
Fixing wrongly dormant intentions with 10 day threshold...
Checking each dormant intention for subtree activity...
Awakened 3 intention(s) that had recent subtree activity.
```

## Configuration

The dormancy threshold can be configured in your config file:

```yaml
intention:
  dormancyThresholdDays: 10
```

See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for details.
