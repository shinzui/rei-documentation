AI-assisted coaching and review. The agent reads your current state to provide insights and suggestions.

## Configuration

The agent requires an LLM backend. See [configuration](/docs/configuration) for setup.

## Global Options

### Debug Mode

All agent commands support `--debug` to output the rendered prompt without invoking the LLM. This is useful for testing prompt construction and debugging context loading.

```bash
rei agent --debug COMMAND
```

**Example:**

```bash
# See the prompt that would be sent for coaching
rei agent --debug coach

# See the review prompt for a specific intention
rei agent --debug review intention_01h455vb4pex

# Debug a reflection prompt
rei agent --debug reflect today
```

**Output:**
```
=== DEBUG: Rendered prompt that would be sent to agent ===

[Full prompt content with all context variables rendered]

=== END DEBUG ===
```

### Interactive Mode

All agent commands support `--interactive` (`-i`) to start an interactive Claude Code session instead of getting a one-shot response.

```bash
rei agent [-i|--interactive] COMMAND
```

**Interactive mode:**
- Starts Claude Code with your current Rei state pre-loaded
- Claude retains all tools (Bash, Read, Edit, etc.)
- All `rei` commands are pre-approved (no permission prompts)
- Supports multi-turn conversations with full context
- Claude can record actions, resolve blockers, and make changes on your behalf

**Example:**

```bash
# Interactive coaching session
rei agent coach -i

# Interactive intention review
rei agent review intention_01h455vb4pex -i
```

## Subcommands

### coach

Get coaching suggestions.

```bash
rei agent coach [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-t, --today` — Focus on today's activities

**Examples:**

```bash
# General coaching
rei agent coach

# Focus on today
rei agent coach --today

# Interactive coaching session
rei agent coach -i
rei agent coach --today -i
```

### review

Review a specific intention with AI assistance.

```bash
rei agent review [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

The agent will analyze the intention's history, actions, blockers, and related notes to provide insights and suggestions.

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Review specific intention
rei agent review intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei agent review

# Interactive review session
rei agent review intention_01h455vb4pex -i
```

### nudge

Get a gentle nudge about what to focus on.

```bash
rei agent nudge
```

This provides a quick suggestion based on your current intentions, blockers, and recent activity.

**Example:**

```bash
# Quick suggestion
rei agent nudge

# Interactive nudge session
rei agent nudge -i
```

### reflect

Get AI-assisted reflection.

```bash
rei agent reflect <period>
```

**Subcommands:**
- `today` — Reflect on today
- `week` — Reflect on the week

**Examples:**

```bash
# AI-assisted daily reflection
rei agent reflect today

# AI-assisted weekly reflection
rei agent reflect week

# Interactive reflection help
rei agent reflect today -i
rei agent reflect week -i
```

## Modes Comparison

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| Non-interactive (default) | Returns a single response, read-only | Quick advice, suggestions |
| Interactive (`-i`) | Multi-turn Claude Code session | Getting unstuck, making changes |

## Important Notes

- **Non-interactive mode** is read-only — the agent does not modify your data
- **Interactive mode** gives Claude full CLI access — it can record actions, resolve blockers, etc.
- All changes in interactive mode are attributed with `--actor claude-code`
- The agent reads your events, markdown files, and read models to understand your current state
