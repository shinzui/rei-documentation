## Configuration

### LLM Backend

Set the backend via environment variable:

export REI_LLM_BACKEND=claude-cli

# Use Anthropic API directly
export REI_LLM_BACKEND=anthropic-api
export REI_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

- Sends relevant context to the LLM
- Never modifies your data
- Processes locally when using claude-cli
