Knowledge management commands for verifying workspace integrity.

## Subcommands

### verify

Verify the integrity of the knowledge base (notes, docs, reflections).

```bash
rei knowledge verify [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-v, --verbose` — Show detailed output (all files, not just failures)
- `-e, --embeds` — Also verify embedded files (`![[file.pdf]]`) in notes

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic verification
rei knowledge verify

# Verbose output
rei knowledge verify --verbose

# Verify with embeds
rei knowledge verify --embeds

# Verbose with embeds
rei knowledge verify -v -e
```

This command checks that:
- All referenced files exist
- File hashes match stored values (detecting external modifications)
- Links between entities are valid
- Embedded files (`![[...]]`) exist when `--embeds` is specified

**Output:**

The verification shows a summary of:
- Total files checked
- Files OK (matching hash)
- Files with hash mismatches (externally modified)
- Missing files

When `--embeds` is enabled, it also shows:
- Total embeds discovered in notes
- Embeds pointing to existing files
- Embeds pointing to missing files
