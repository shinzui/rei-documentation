Display a daily dashboard showing today's summary. This is your primary view for understanding what needs attention each day.

```bash
rei today [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context (e.g., `work`, `personal`)
- `--include-dormant` — Include dormant intentions (excluded by default)
- `--tui` — Launch interactive TUI dashboard

## Dashboard Sections

The dashboard displays the following sections:

### Active Cycle & Focus

If you have an active focus cycle, shows:
- Cycle name and progress (e.g., "Day 3/14, 11 days remaining")
- Today's designated focus area (if set)

### Triggered Reminders

Reminders that have triggered and need attention, shown with their scheduled time and anchor type.

### Active Intentions

Your active intentions, either:
- **Grouped by context** (when no filter applied) — organized under context headers like "▸ work", "▸ personal"
- **Flat list** (when filtered by `-c`) — showing only matching intentions

Each intention shows:
- Active days count (e.g., `[45d]`) — the number of distinct days with recorded actions
- Action count if you've taken actions today
- "(blocked)" indicator if it has unresolved blockers
- Deadline date if set (e.g., `due: 2026-02-15`)

### Completed Today

Intentions completed today, grouped by context (or flat when filtered).

### Tasks

Tasks organized by urgency:
- **Overdue** — Tasks past their due date (shown in red)
- **Due Today** — Tasks due today (shown in yellow)
- **Upcoming** — Tasks due within the next 7 days

### Today's Actions

Chronological list of actions recorded today, showing:
- Time performed (in your local timezone)
- Description
- Duration (if tracked)
- Attached notes (if any)

### Blockers

Active blockers with age indicator (e.g., "3 days").

### Habits

Scheduled habits for today with completion status:
- ✓ indicates completed
- ○ indicates pending
- Active days indicator (e.g., `[30d]`) showing distinct days with recorded actions

### Cue-Based Habits

Habits triggered by context/cues rather than schedules, showing:
- Cue trigger description
- Target frequency (e.g., "2/week")
- When last performed (e.g., "today", "yesterday", "3 days ago")
- Active days indicator (e.g., `[30d]`) showing distinct days with recorded actions

### Pending Reflections

Scheduled reflections that are due but not yet completed.

## Examples

```bash
# Show full dashboard
rei today

# Filter to work context only
rei today --context work

# Include dormant intentions
rei today --include-dormant

# Launch interactive TUI mode
rei today --tui
```

## TUI Mode

The `--tui` flag launches an interactive terminal UI where you can:
- Navigate between sections
- Expand/collapse items
- Take quick actions

**Note:** TUI mode requires a terminal that supports ANSI escape codes.

## Notes

- Times are displayed in your local timezone
- The dashboard requires a database backend (PostgreSQL)
- Context filtering shows intentions whose root ancestor has the matching context
- Linked habits inherit context from their linked intention
- Dormant intentions (inactive for 30+ days) are excluded by default; use `--include-dormant` to show them
