Track unplanned reactive work that interrupts your focused activities. Disruptions represent recurring sources of interruption like infrastructure issues, urgent requests, or external dependencies.

## Concepts

**Disruption** — A recurring source of unplanned work identified by a unique source name (e.g., "redis-timeouts", "slack-interrupts"). Each disruption tracks:
- Total occurrences (instance count)
- Status: active, addressed, or resolved
- Optional description and category

**Disruption Actions** — Individual occurrences are recorded as actions in the `rei today` dashboard under a "Disruptions" section, showing what reactive work happened and when.

## Subcommands

### record

Record a disruption occurrence. Creates the disruption if it doesn't exist, or increments the instance count if it does.

```bash
rei disruption record <source> [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<source>` — Unique identifier for the disruption (e.g., "redis-timeouts")

**Options:**
- `-d, --description <text>` — Description of the disruption
- `-c, --category <id>` — Category ID for the disruption
- `-t, --duration <duration>` — How long the disruption took
- `-a, --at <time>` — When the disruption occurred (default: now)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Record a disruption
rei disruption record redis-timeouts

# Record with description
rei disruption record slack-interrupts -d "Urgent request from marketing"

# Record with time and duration
rei disruption record deploy-failure --at "2 hours ago" --duration 45m
```

### list

List disruptions filtered by status.

```bash
rei disruption list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-s, --status <status>` — Filter by status: active, addressed, resolved
- `-a, --all` — Show all disruptions including resolved

**Examples:**

```bash
# List active disruptions (default)
rei disruption list

# List addressed disruptions
rei disruption list --status addressed

# List all disruptions
rei disruption list --all
```

### show

Show details for a specific disruption.

```bash
rei disruption show <source>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<source>` — Disruption source identifier

**Examples:**

```bash
rei disruption show redis-timeouts
```

### update

Update the description of a disruption.

```bash
rei disruption update <source> <description>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<source>` — Disruption source identifier
- `<description>` — New description

**Examples:**

```bash
rei disruption update redis-timeouts "Redis connection pool exhaustion during peak hours"
```

### set-category

Set or change the category of a disruption.

```bash
rei disruption set-category <source> -c <category> | --clear
```

**Arguments:**
- `<source>` — Disruption source identifier

**Options:**
- `-c, --category <id>` — Category ID to set
- `--clear` — Clear the category

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set category
rei disruption set-category redis-timeouts -c infrastructure

# Clear category
rei disruption set-category redis-timeouts --clear
```

### mark-addressed

Mark a disruption as addressed without linking to an intention.

```bash
rei disruption mark-addressed [source] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[source]` — Disruption source identifier (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `-n, --note <text>` — Note explaining how it was addressed

> **FZF Support:** If the source is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active disruptions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Mark with explicit source
rei disruption mark-addressed redis-timeouts --note "Increased connection pool size"

# Use FZF to select
rei disruption mark-addressed
```

### resolve

Resolve a disruption (must be addressed first).

```bash
rei disruption resolve <source>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<source>` — Disruption source identifier

**Examples:**

```bash
rei disruption resolve redis-timeouts
```

### reopen

Reopen a resolved disruption.

```bash
rei disruption reopen <source> [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<source>` — Disruption source identifier

**Options:**
- `-r, --reason <text>` — Reason for reopening

**Examples:**

```bash
rei disruption reopen redis-timeouts --reason "Issue recurred after deployment"
```

## Workflow

1. **Record** disruptions as they occur with `rei disruption record`
2. **Review** active disruptions with `rei disruption list`
3. **Address** disruptions when you've taken action with `rei disruption mark-addressed`
4. **Resolve** disruptions when completely fixed with `rei disruption resolve`

Disruption actions appear in `rei today` under a dedicated "Disruptions" section, helping you see how much time is spent on reactive work versus planned intentions.
