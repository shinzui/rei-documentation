Track unplanned reactive work that interrupts your focused activities. Disruptions represent recurring sources of interruption like infrastructure issues, urgent requests, or external dependencies.

## Concepts

**Disruption** — A recurring source of unplanned work identified by a unique source name (e.g., "redis-timeouts", "slack-interrupts"). Each disruption tracks:
- Total occurrences (instance count)
- Status: active, addressed, or resolved
- Optional description and category

**Disruption Actions** — Individual occurrences are recorded as actions in the `rei today` dashboard under a "Disruptions" section, showing what reactive work happened and when.

## Subcommands

### record

Record a disruption occurrence. Creates the disruption if it doesn't exist, or increments the instance count if it does.

```bash
rei disruption record <source> [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<source>` — Unique identifier for the disruption (e.g., "redis-timeouts")

**Options:**
- `-d, --description <text>` — Description of the disruption
- `--category <id>` — Category ID for the disruption
- `-c, --context <context>` — Context for the disruption (e.g., `work`, `personal`)
- `-t, --duration <duration>` — How long the disruption took
- `-a, --at <time>` — When the disruption occurred (default: now)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Record a disruption
rei disruption record redis-timeouts

# Record with description
rei disruption record slack-interrupts -d "Urgent request from marketing"

# Record with time and duration
rei disruption record deploy-failure --at "2 hours ago" --duration 45m

# Record with context
rei disruption record redis-timeouts -c work
```

### list

List disruptions filtered by status.

```bash
rei disruption list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-s, --status <status>` — Filter by status: active, addressed, resolved
- `-a, --all` — Show all disruptions including resolved
- `-w, --where <filter>` — Filter by custom property value (see examples below)

**Examples:**

```bash
# List active disruptions (default)
rei disruption list

# List addressed disruptions
rei disruption list --status addressed

# List all disruptions
rei disruption list --all

# Filter by custom property (exact match)
rei disruption list --where severity=high

# Filter by numeric property (comparison operators)
rei disruption list --where "impact>=5"
```

**Property Filter Syntax:**
- `key=value` — Exact match (works with enum, text, and state properties)
- `key>N`, `key>=N`, `key<N`, `key<=N` — Numeric comparison (for int properties)

**Notes:**
- Property filters require custom properties to be defined (see [`rei custom-property`](/docs/commands/custom-property))

### show

Show details for a specific disruption.

```bash
rei disruption show [source]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[source]` — Disruption source identifier (optional if fzf is available)

```

## Workflow

1. **Record** disruptions as they occur with `rei disruption record`
2. **Review** active disruptions with `rei disruption list`
3. **Address** disruptions when you've taken action with `rei disruption mark-addressed`
4. **Resolve** disruptions when completely fixed with `rei disruption resolve`

Disruption actions appear in `rei today` under a dedicated "Disruptions" section, helping you see how much time is spent on reactive work versus planned intentions.
