Schedule and complete reflections. Reflections are structured review sessions.

## Subcommands

### today

Start or continue today's daily reflection.

```bash
rei reflect today [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-p, --prompt <text>` — Custom prompt text

**Behavior:**
1. Creates a reflection file at `reflections/<date>.md`
2. Opens your `$EDITOR`
3. On save, records the reflection as completed

**Examples:**

```bash
# Start daily reflection
rei reflect today

# With a custom prompt
rei reflect today --prompt "Focus on what blocked you today"
```

### week

Start or continue this week's reflection.

```bash
rei reflect week [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-p, --prompt <text>` — Custom prompt text

**Example:**

```bash
rei reflect week
```

### intention

Start a reflection focused on a specific intention.

```bash
rei reflect intention <intention-id>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<intention-id>` — Intention ID (required)

**Example:**

```bash
rei reflect intention intention_01h455vb4pex
```

### pending

List all pending (scheduled but not completed) reflections.

```bash
rei reflect pending
```

### history

Show reflection history.

```bash
rei reflect history [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-n, --limit <n>` — Number of reflections to show (default: 10)
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show last 20 reflections
rei reflect history -n 20

# Show reflections filtered by context
rei reflect history --context work

# Combine filters
rei reflect history --context personal -n 5
```

**Notes:**
- Intention-anchored reflections inherit context from their intention
- Daily and weekly reflections can also be filtered if they have associated context

### open

Open an existing reflection in your editor.

```bash
rei reflect open [reflection-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[reflection-id]` — Reflection ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from recent reflections.

**Example:**

```bash
rei reflect open reflection_01h455vb4pex
```

### complete

Mark a reflection as completed.

```bash
rei reflect complete [reflection-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[reflection-id]` — Reflection ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from in-progress reflections.

This is useful when you've edited a reflection file directly and want to mark it as done.

### cycle

Start a reflection for a completed cycle.

```bash
rei reflect cycle [cycle-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[cycle-id]` — Cycle ID to reflect on (optional, defaults to last completed cycle)

**Options:**
- `-p, --prompt <text>` — Custom prompt text
- `--stdin` — Read reflection content from stdin
- `--actor <name>` — Creator identifier (e.g., "user", "claude-code")

> **FZF Support:** If the cycle ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from completed cycles.

**Behavior:**
1. Loads context from the completed cycle (focus selections, duration, etc.)
2. Creates a reflection file with cycle summary
3. Opens your `$EDITOR`
4. On save, records the reflection as completed

**Examples:**

```bash
# Reflect on last completed cycle
rei reflect cycle

# Reflect on a specific cycle
rei reflect cycle cycle_01abc123...

# With a custom prompt
rei reflect cycle --prompt "What did you learn this cycle?"
```

### skip

Skip a scheduled reflection.

```bash
rei reflect skip [reflection-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

**Options:**
- `-r, --reason <text>` — Reason for skipping

```bash
rei reflect skip reflection_01h455vb4pex --reason "Traveling today"
```
