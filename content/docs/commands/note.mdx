Notes are markdown files stored in your workspace. They can contain free-form thoughts, meeting notes, ideas, and more.

## Subcommands

### new

Create a new note.

```bash
rei note new [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-t, --title <title>` — Note title
- `--tags <tags>` — Comma-separated tags

Opens your editor to write the note content.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Simple note
rei note new --title "Meeting Notes"

# Note with tags
rei note new --title "Project Ideas" --tags "ideas,work"
```

### list

List all notes.

```bash
rei note list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-f, --format <format>` — Output format
- `--tag <tag>` — Filter by tag

### open

Open a note for editing.

```bash
rei note open [id]
```

If ID is not provided and fzf is installed, you'll get an interactive picker.

## Task Extraction

Notes can contain markdown checkboxes that rei recognizes as tasks:

```markdown
## Meeting Notes

- [x] Send follow-up email
- [ ] Schedule next meeting
- [ ] Review proposal
```

Extract tasks from a note:

```bash
rei note extract-tasks [id]
```

## Workspace

Notes are stored as markdown files in your workspace directory (default: `~/rei-workspace/notes/`).

You can edit them directly with any text editor or use `rei note open`.
