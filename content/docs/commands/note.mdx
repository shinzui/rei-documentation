Create and manage markdown notes attached to entities, including daily notes.

## Features

### Automatic Title Extraction

Notes automatically extract their title from the first `# ` (H1) heading in the markdown content. The title is displayed in note listings and stored for querying.

### Task Extraction

Notes can contain markdown task lists (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`). Tasks are:
- Automatically discovered when notes are created or updated
- Tracked with content-based hashing for idempotency
- Propagated to their parent entities (intention, action, outcome, or reflection)
- Synchronized bidirectionally (completing a task in the note updates the entity)

## Subcommands

### new

Create a new note.

```bash
rei note new [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Attach to intention (optional if fzf is available)
- `-a, --action <id>` — Attach to action
- `-o, --outcome <id>` — Attach to outcome
- `-r, --reflection <id>` — Attach to reflection
- `-h, --habit <id>` — Attach to habit
- `-t, --tag <tag>` — Add tag (repeatable)
- `--actor <name>` — Creator identifier (e.g., "user", "claude-code")
- `--stdin` — Read content from stdin instead of opening editor

Notes require an anchor entity (intention or habit), and can optionally be attached to a sub-entity (action, outcome, or reflection) when anchored to an intention.

> **FZF Support:** If `-i` is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a note for an intention
rei note new -i intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention interactively
rei note new

# Create a note for an action with tags
rei note new -i intention_01h455vb4pex -a action_01h455vb4pex -t decision -t architecture

# Create a note for a reflection
rei note new -i intention_01h455vb4pex -r reflection_01h455vb4pex

# Create a note for a habit
rei note new --habit habit_01h455vb4pex
```

### today

Open or create today's daily note.

```bash
rei note today [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-d, --date <YYYY-MM-DD>` — Date for the note (defaults to today)
- `-t, --tag <tag>` — Add tag (repeatable)
- `--actor <name>` — Creator identifier (e.g., "user", "claude-code")

Daily notes are anchored to a **JournalEntry** entity — each day gets its own unique ID. This allows notes to be properly linked to a specific day while reusing all the standard note infrastructure.

**Behavior:**
1. Determines the target day (today or from `--date` override)
2. Gets or creates a JournalEntry for that day
3. Checks if a note already exists for that journal entry
4. If note exists → opens it in `$EDITOR`
5. If no note exists → creates a new note and opens it in `$EDITOR`
6. On save, emits events for async processing (title extraction, tasks)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Open or create today's daily note
rei note today

# Create/open note for a specific date
rei note today --date 2026-01-10

# Create today's note with tags
rei note today -t journal -t personal
```

**Use Cases:**
- Daily journaling and planning
- Quick capture of daily thoughts
- Daily standup notes
- Time-boxed reflection

**Daily Note Task Due Dates:**

Tasks added to daily notes automatically get a due date set to that day. For example, if you add `- [ ] Review PR` to your January 15th daily note, that task will have a due date of January 15th.

### list

List notes with their titles.

```bash
rei note list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Filter by intention (includes notes on sub-entities)
- `-a, --action <id>` — Filter by action
- `-o, --outcome <id>` — Filter by outcome
- `-r, --reflection <id>` — Filter by reflection
- `-h, --habit <id>` — Filter by habit
- `-t, --tag <tag>` — Filter by tag

> **FZF Support:** If no filter option is provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select an entity to filter by.

**Intention Filter — Smart Aggregation:**

When filtering by intention (`-i`), the command shows **all notes within that intention's scope**, including:
- Notes attached directly to the intention
- Notes attached to actions under that intention
- Notes attached to outcomes under that intention
- Notes attached to reflections under that intention

Notes are grouped by anchor type for readability.

**Examples:**

```bash
# List all notes for an intention (includes notes on actions, outcomes, reflections)
rei note list -i intention_01h455vb4pex

# List notes for a specific action only
rei note list -a action_01h455vb4pex

# List notes for a habit
rei note list --habit habit_01h455vb4pex

# List all notes with a specific tag
rei note list --tag architecture

# Use fzf to select an entity interactively
rei note list
```

### open

Open a note in your editor.

```bash
rei note open [note-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[note-id]` — Note ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If note ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from existing notes.

**Behavior:**
1. Opens the note file in your `$EDITOR`
2. After editing, computes content hash and compares with stored hash
3. If content changed, emits a `NoteContentUpdated` event
4. Title and tasks are re-extracted automatically

### add-tags

Add tags to an existing note.

```bash
rei note add-tags [note-id] -t <tag> [-t <tag>...]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[note-id]` — Note ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `-t, --tag <tag>` — Tag to add (required, repeatable)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add a single tag
rei note add-tags note_01h455vb4pex -t decision

# Add multiple tags
rei note add-tags note_01h455vb4pex -t architecture -t important

# Use fzf to select note
rei note add-tags -t todo
```

### remove-tags

```bash
rei note backlinks [note-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[note-id]` — Note ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from existing notes.

**Output includes:**
- Source note ID
- Wikilink text (e.g., `[[Project Notes]]`)
- Line number where the link appears
- Display text if using alias syntax (`[[Target|Display Text]]`)
- Discovery timestamp

```bash
# Show all notes linking to a specific note
rei note backlinks note_01h455vb4pex

# Use fzf to select note
rei note backlinks
```

### broken-links

Show unresolved wikilinks (references to notes that don't exist).

```bash
rei note broken-links [note-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[note-id]` — Optional: filter by source note

**Behavior:**
- Without argument: shows all broken links across all notes
- With note ID: shows only broken links from that specific note

**Output includes:**
- Source note ID
- Target title (the text inside `[[...]]`)
- Line number
- Display text if using alias syntax

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show all broken links
rei note broken-links

# Show broken links from a specific note
rei note broken-links note_01h455vb4pex
```

**Use Cases:**
- Finding orphaned references after renaming/deleting notes
- Discovering notes that need to be created
- Auditing note interconnections

## Wikilinks

Notes support wikilink syntax for linking between notes:

```markdown
See [[Project Notes]] for more details.

Check [[Meeting Notes|the meeting notes]] from last week.
```

**Syntax:**
- `[[Note Title]]` — Link to a note by title
- `[[Note Title|Display Text]]` — Link with custom display text

**Processing:**
- Wikilinks are discovered when notes are created or updated
- References are automatically resolved when a matching note title exists
- If a note is deleted or renamed, references may become "broken"

**Resolution:**
- When a note's title is extracted, any unresolved references matching that title are automatically resolved
- Use `rei note broken-links` to find unresolved references

## Workspace

Notes are stored as markdown files in your workspace directory (default: `.rei/notes/`).

You can edit them directly with any text editor or use `rei note open`.
