Intentions are the core building blocks of rei, representing goals, projects, or commitments you want to accomplish.

## Intention Status

Intentions have one of four statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Currently being worked on. Shown in daily dashboard and reviews. |
| **Future** | Planned but not yet active. Hidden from today view until activated. |
| **Completed** | Successfully finished. Terminal state. |
| **Abandoned** | No longer pursuing. Terminal state with optional reason. |

**Lifecycle:**
- New intentions start as **Active** by default
- Use `--future` flag during creation for deferred intentions
- Use `defer` to move an Active intention to **Future** (defers children too)
- Use `activate` to move a Future intention back to **Active**
- Use `complete` or `abandon` for terminal states

## Subcommands

### create

Create a new intention.

```bash
rei intention create <title> [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<title>` — The title of the intention (use `-` to read from stdin)

**Options:**
- `-p, --parent <id>` — Parent intention ID (creates a sub-intention)
- `-h, --horizon <horizon>` — Time horizon (e.g., `1d`, `1w`, `1m`, `1y`)
- `-d, --deadline <date>` — Deadline date (e.g., `2026-02-15`, `next friday`)
- `-c, --context <context>` — Context label (e.g., `work`, `personal`)
- `--future` — Create as Future (deferred) instead of Active
- `--actor <actor>` — Actor performing this action (overrides global `--actor`)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a top-level intention
rei intention create "Build personal website"

# Create a sub-intention
rei intention create "Design homepage" --parent intention_01h455vb4pex

# Create with a time horizon
rei intention create "Learn Haskell" --horizon 3m

# Create with context
rei intention create "Quarterly planning" --context work

# Create from stdin
echo "Write documentation" | rei intention create -

# Create as Future (deferred) intention
rei intention create "Plan vacation" --future

# Create a Future intention with horizon
rei intention create "Q2 project planning" --future --horizon 3m

# Create with a deadline
rei intention create "Submit proposal" --deadline 2026-02-15

# Create with both horizon and deadline
rei intention create "Complete project" --horizon 2w --deadline "next friday"
```

**Notes:**
- Context can only be set on root intentions (those without a parent)
- Child intentions inherit context from their root ancestor
- Use `--future` to create intentions you want to plan now but activate later

### list

List intentions by status.

```bash
rei intention list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-f, --format <format>` — Output format: `default`, `fzf`, or `json`
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context (includes child intentions of matching roots)
- `--category <slug>` — Filter by category slug
- `-w, --where <filter>` — Filter by custom property value (see examples below)
- `--state-tag <tag>` — Filter by state machine tag: `queue`, `active`, `done`, `terminal`
- `-g, --group-by <property>` — Group output by custom property value
- `--future` — Show only Future (deferred) intentions
- `--all` — Show both Active and Future intentions
- `--dormant` — Show only dormant intentions

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default: list active intentions only
rei intention list

# List future intentions only
rei intention list --future

# List both active and future intentions
rei intention list --all

# Filter by context
rei intention list --context work

# Combine status and context filters
rei intention list --future --context work

# FZF-compatible tab-separated output (ID, title, horizon)
rei intention list --format=fzf

# JSON output
rei intention list --format=json

# Filter by custom property (exact match)
rei intention list --where priority=high

# Filter by numeric property (comparison operators)
rei intention list --where "effort>=5"
rei intention list --where "effort<3"

# Filter by category
rei intention list --category projects
rei intention list --category projects --future

# Filter by state machine tag (any property with that tag)
rei intention list --state-tag queue      # Items waiting to be worked on
rei intention list --state-tag active     # Items currently in progress
rei intention list --state-tag done       # Completed items
rei intention list --state-tag terminal   # Items in final states

# Group output by custom property
rei intention list --group-by priority
rei intention list --group-by status --context work

# Combine grouping with filters
rei intention list --where "effort>=3" --group-by priority
```

The `--format=fzf` output is designed for shell scripting and fzf widgets. Each line contains: `ID<tab>title<tab>horizon`

**Property Filter Syntax:**
- `key=value` — Exact match (works with enum, text, and state properties)
- `key>N`, `key>=N`, `key<N`, `key<=N` — Numeric comparison (for int properties)
- `key:exists` — Filter to intentions that have the property set (any value)
- `key:tag=value` — State machine tag query

**State Tag Filter:**

The `--state-tag` option filters intentions by state machine system tags across **any** state machine property. This is useful when you have state machine properties like `task-status` or `review-status` and want to find all items in a particular state category without knowing which specific property or state value to query.

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `queue` | Items waiting to be worked on |
| `active` | Items currently in progress |
| `done` | Completed items |
| `terminal` | Items in final states (no further transitions) |

**Grouping Output:**

The `--group-by` option groups intentions by a custom property value, displaying them in sections:

```
Found 12 active intention(s):

priority: 5 (3)
  intention_01abc... Critical bug fix         [1w]
  intention_01def... Complete Q1 review       [2w]
  intention_01ghi... Launch feature           [3d]

priority: 3 (5)
  intention_01jkl... Update documentation     [1m]
  ...

priority: (none) (4)
  intention_01xyz... Explore new tech         [3m]
  ...
```

- State machine properties are sorted by `stateOrder` (ascending), then alphabetically
- Numeric values are sorted descending (highest first)
- Text values are sorted alphabetically
- Intentions without the property are grouped under "(none)" at the end
- Only works with the default output format (ignored for `fzf` and `json`)
- Compatible with all other filters (`--where`, `--context`, `--category`, `--state-tag`)

**Notes:**
- Default behavior shows only Active intentions
- Completed and Abandoned intentions are never shown in list output
- When filtering by context, both root intentions with that context and their children are included
- Context and category filters are mutually exclusive
- Context is displayed in list output when present
- Property filters require custom properties to be defined (see [`rei custom-property`](/docs/commands/custom-property))

For comprehensive filtering documentation, see [Intention Filtering](/docs/guides/intention-filtering).

### show

Show details of a specific intention.

```bash
rei intention show [id] [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--full` — Show full details including actions, outcomes, blockers, notes
- `--json` — Output as JSON (requires `--full`)

> **FZF Support:** If ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Full view includes:**
- Intention details (title, horizon, context, status)
- **Overview Note** (designated entry-point note, if set)
- Recent actions taken (with associated notes, links, and docs)
- Recorded outcomes
- Active blockers
- Dependencies
- Supports (what this intention supports)
- Supported By (what supports this intention)
- Associated notes (grouped by category, with uncategorized shown last)
- Attached links and documents
- Tasks
- Linked habits
- Reminders (active and past, with status icons and scheduled times)
- Custom properties (any properties assigned to this intention)
- Child intentions (both Active and Future; excludes Completed/Abandoned)

### tree

Show intention hierarchy as a tree.

```bash
rei intention tree [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-f, --future` — Show future intentions with their parent chains
- `-a, --all` — Show both active and future intentions with status indicators
- `--completed` — Show completed intentions with their parent chains
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context
- `--tui` — Launch interactive TUI for browsing the hierarchy

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default: show active intentions only
rei intention tree

# Show future intentions (with ancestor chains for context)
rei intention tree --future

# Show both active and future intentions
rei intention tree --all

# Show completed intentions (with ancestor chains for context)
rei intention tree --completed

# Filter by context
rei intention tree --context work

# Combine flags
rei intention tree --future --context personal

# Launch interactive TUI
rei intention tree --tui
```

**Output:**
- Default view shows only active intentions in tree format
- `--future` shows future intentions with their active parent chains (future items highlighted in cyan)
- `--completed` shows completed intentions with their parent chains (completed items highlighted in green)
- `--all` shows active and future together, with `(future)` indicators on deferred items

**Interactive TUI Mode:**

The `--tui` flag launches an interactive terminal UI for browsing the intention hierarchy:

- **Navigation**: Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to move up/down
- **Filter**: Press `/` to enter filter mode, type to fuzzy-search by title
- **View details**: Press `Enter` to open the full detail view for an intention
- **Copy ID**: Press `y` to yank (copy) the selected intention ID to clipboard
- **Add child**: Press `a` to open the child intention creation form
- **Open notes**: In detail view, press `o` to open notes (FZF picker if multiple)
- **Close views**: Press `Esc` to close detail view or form, or cancel filter
- **Quit**: Press `q` to exit

**Filtering:**

Press `/` to enter filter mode. As you type, the list filters in real-time using fuzzy matching:

- Type any characters to match against intention titles (non-contiguous matches work, e.g., "abc" matches "Add blocker component")
- Matched characters are highlighted in yellow
- Match count shows as `(3/15)` in the filter bar
- Navigate with `j`/`k` while filtering
- Press `Enter` to view details (filter persists when returning)
- Press `Esc` to clear the filter and show all intentions

**Child Intention Creation Form:**

Press `a` on any intention to open an inline form for creating a child intention:

- **Title**: The name of the new intention (required)
- **Horizon**: Optional time horizon (e.g., `1w`, `3m`, `1y`)
- **Start as Future**: Checkbox to create as a Future intention instead of Active

Use `Tab` to move between fields, `Enter` to create the intention, and `Esc` to cancel.

**Annotations:** Each intention in the TUI tree view displays helpful annotations:
- Horizon (e.g., `1w`, `3m`)
- Active days count (e.g., `5d`)
- Deadline (e.g., `DL: 2026-02-15`)
- Context (e.g., `work`, `personal`)
- Status indicators (e.g., `(future)`, `(dormant)`)

The TUI works with all tree variants (active, future, completed, all) and respects context filtering.

**Clipboard support:** The `y` key copies to clipboard using `pbcopy` (macOS), `wl-copy` (Wayland), or `xclip` (X11). A confirmation message appears in the footer.

### complete

Mark an intention as completed.

```bash
rei intention complete [id]
```

### abandon

Abandon an intention.

```bash
rei intention abandon [id] [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-r, --reason <reason>` — Optional reason for abandoning

**Notes:**
- Abandonment is a terminal state — abandoned intentions cannot be reactivated
- Recording a reason helps with future reflection on what didn't work
- **Cascade behavior:** Abandoning an intention automatically abandons all of its pending tasks with the reason "Parent intention abandoned"

### defer

Move an intention to Future status.

```bash
rei intention defer [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Deferred intentions move to **Future** status and are hidden from daily views
- **Cascade behavior:** Deferring a parent automatically defers all active children
- Future intentions allow structural changes (parent, horizon, context) but block operational changes
- Use `activate` to bring a Future intention back to Active status

### activate

Move a Future intention back to Active.

```bash
rei intention activate [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Only Future intentions can be activated
- **Tree coherence:** Cannot activate an intention if its parent is still Future

### blocked

Show intentions that have unresolved blockers.

```bash
rei intention blocked [options]
```

### timeline

Show chronological event history for an intention.

```bash
rei intention timeline [id]
```

**Example output:**

```
Timeline: Learn Haskell

2024-12-01  Created
2024-12-01  Action: Set up development environment
2024-12-03  Action: Completed first tutorial
2024-12-05  Blocker: Can't understand monads
2024-12-07  Blocker resolved
2024-12-10  Outcome: Built first CLI tool
```

### get-help

Get AI-assisted help for an intention.

```bash
rei intention get-help [id]
```

Launches an interactive Claude Code session with full context about the intention.

**What it does:**
1. Gathers comprehensive context about the intention
2. Launches Claude Code interactively with research tools
3. Helps you make progress by analyzing blockers and suggesting next steps

### set-context / clear-context

Set or clear the context for a root intention.

```bash
rei intention set-context [id] <context>
rei intention clear-context [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Context can only be set on root intentions
- Child intentions and linked habits inherit context from the root

### contexts

List all contexts currently in use.

```bash
rei intention contexts
```

### set-horizon / clear-horizon

Set or clear the time horizon.

```bash
rei intention set-horizon [id] <horizon>
rei intention clear-horizon [id]
```

**Horizon formats:**
- `1d` — 1 day
- `1w` — 1 week
- `1m` — 1 month
- `1y` — 1 year
- Custom text like `"end of quarter"`

### guidance

Edit AI guidance for an intention (opens in $EDITOR).

```bash
rei intention guidance [id]
```

This opens your configured editor to edit custom guidance that the AI coach uses when reviewing this intention.

### set-category

Assign a category to an intention. Categories help classify and organize intentions for filtering and reporting.

```bash
rei intention set-category [-i ID] CATEGORY_SLUG
```

**Arguments:**
- `CATEGORY_SLUG` — Category slug (e.g., 'work', 'personal/health')

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If `-i` is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set category with explicit ID
rei intention set-category -i intention_01h455vb4pex work

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention set-category work
```

**Notes:**
- Categories are different from contexts: contexts are for root intention grouping while categories are a flexible classification system
- Categories can be hierarchical (e.g., `work/meeting`)

### clear-category

Remove the category from an intention.

```bash
rei intention clear-category [id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Clear category with explicit ID
rei intention clear-category intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention clear-category
```

### remind

Create a reminder for an intention. This is a shortcut for `rei reminder create --intention`.

```bash
rei intention remind [intention-id] <description> --at <time>
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)
- `<description>` — Reminder description

**Options:**
- `-t, --at <time>` — When to trigger the reminder (required)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a reminder for tomorrow
rei intention remind intention_01abc... "Follow up on proposal" --at tomorrow

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention remind "Check progress" --at "1 week"
```

See [`rei reminder`](/docs/commands/reminder) for full reminder documentation.

### set-overview

Designate a note as the overview note for an intention. The overview note serves as an entry point providing summary or context, and is displayed prominently in `show --full` output.

```bash
rei intention set-overview [intention-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `-n, --note <note-id>` — Note ID to set as overview (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If IDs are not provided, interactive pickers will let you select from active intentions and their associated notes.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set with explicit IDs
rei intention set-overview intention_01abc... --note note_01xyz...

# Let fzf pick both
rei intention set-overview
```

**Notes:**
- The note must be anchored to the target intention (not a different intention or a habit)
- Only one note can be the overview at a time; setting a new one replaces the previous
- Overview notes appear in a dedicated "Overview Note" section in `intention show --full`

### clear-overview

Remove the overview note designation from an intention.

```bash
rei intention clear-overview [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Clear with explicit ID
rei intention clear-overview intention_01abc...

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention clear-overview
```

### note open

Open a note attached to an intention. Shows notes both directly attached to the intention and those attached to its actions, outcomes, and reflections.

```bash
rei intention note open [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will show intentions that have notes. After selecting an intention, another FZF picker shows all attached notes to choose from.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Open a note for a specific intention
rei intention note open intention_01abc...

# Let fzf pick the intention first, then the note
rei intention note open
```

### set-note-guidance

Set AI guidance for notes under an intention. This guidance is automatically included when getting help with any note anchored to this intention.

```bash
rei intention set-note-guidance [intention-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `--content <text>` — Guidance content (optional, opens $EDITOR if not provided)
- `--stdin` — Read guidance from stdin

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Open editor to write guidance
rei intention set-note-guidance intention_01abc...

# Set guidance directly
rei intention set-note-guidance intention_01abc... --content "Focus on practical examples"

# Pipe guidance from file
cat guidance.md | rei intention set-note-guidance intention_01abc... --stdin
```

**Use Case:**

When you have multiple notes under an intention that all need similar help context (e.g., "focus on practical examples" or "use simple language"), set note guidance once on the intention rather than repeating `--focus` on every `note get-help` call.

### show-note-guidance

Show the current note guidance for an intention.

```bash
rei intention show-note-guidance [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show with explicit ID
rei intention show-note-guidance intention_01abc...

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention show-note-guidance
```

### clear-note-guidance

Remove note guidance from an intention.

```bash
rei intention clear-note-guidance [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Clear with explicit ID
rei intention clear-note-guidance intention_01abc...

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention clear-note-guidance
```

### set-deadline

Set a deadline date for an intention.

```bash
rei intention set-deadline [id] <date>
```

**Arguments:**
- `[id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)
- `<date>` — Deadline date (e.g., `2026-02-15`, `next friday`, `in 2 weeks`)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set deadline with explicit ID
rei intention set-deadline intention_01h455vb4pex 2026-02-15

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention set-deadline "next friday"

# Use relative date expressions
rei intention set-deadline intention_01h455vb4pex "in 2 weeks"
```

**Notes:**
- Deadlines are displayed in the today dashboard and intention annotations
- Setting a deadline automatically creates a reminder if the intention has a horizon
- Use `clear-deadline` to remove the deadline

### clear-deadline

Remove the deadline from an intention.

```bash
rei intention clear-deadline [id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Clear deadline with explicit ID
rei intention clear-deadline intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention clear-deadline
```

### tracker

Show a visual activity tracker for an intention. Displays action frequency over time in either calendar or heatmap style.

```bash
rei intention tracker [id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `-d, --days <n>` — Number of days to show (default: 90)
- `-s, --style <style>` — Display style: `calendar` (default) or `heatmap`
- `--include-children` — Include actions from child intentions

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Display Styles:**

**calendar** (default) — Shows a week-by-week calendar with intensity levels:
```
Activity Tracker: Build personal website (90 days)

Dec 30-05  ·  ·  ●  ○  ·  ·  ·
Jan 06-12  ○  ·  ○  ◉  ○  ·  ·
Jan 13-19  ·  ·  ○  ·  ·  ·  ·

Legend: · (none)  ○ (1-2)  ● (3-4)  ◉ (5+)
```

**heatmap** — GitHub-style contribution graph using colored blocks:
```
Activity Tracker: Build personal website (90 days)
Actions: 23 in 90 days (avg 0.3/day)

[GitHub-style heatmap visualization]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show tracker with default settings (90 days, calendar style)
rei intention tracker intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention tracker

# Show last 30 days
rei intention tracker -d 30

# Use heatmap visualization
rei intention tracker --style heatmap

# Include child intention actions
rei intention tracker --include-children

# Combine options
rei intention tracker -d 180 --style heatmap --include-children
```

**Notes:**
- The tracker aggregates all actions recorded for the intention
- `--include-children` recursively includes actions from all descendant intentions
- Useful for visualizing work patterns and maintaining consistency

### view

Execute a view scoped to an intention. Views provide reusable, multi-section configurations for displaying intentions and related entities.

```bash
rei intention view [INTENTION_ID] [VIEW_NAME]
```

**Arguments:**
- `INTENTION_ID` — Intention ID (optional, uses FZF selection if not provided)
- `VIEW_NAME` — View name (optional, uses FZF selection if not provided)

> **FZF Support:** If arguments are not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, interactive pickers will let you select the intention and view.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Execute a view on an intention with explicit IDs
rei intention view int_01abc123 project-review

# Let fzf pick both the intention and view
rei intention view

# Let fzf pick just the view
rei intention view int_01abc123
```

**Notes:**
- Views are created using `rei view create` from YAML configuration files
- See [`rei view`](/docs/commands/view) for view management commands
- See the [Views Guide](/docs/guides/views) for YAML configuration details

### set-property

Set a custom property on an intention.

```bash
rei intention set-property [-i ID] PROPERTY_KEY VALUE
```

**Arguments:**
- `PROPERTY_KEY` — The key of the custom property to set
- `VALUE` — The value to assign (validated against property definition)

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If `-i` is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set property with explicit ID
rei intention set-property -i intention_01h455vb4pex priority high

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention set-property priority high

# Set a numeric property
rei intention set-property -i intention_01h455vb4pex effort 5
```

**Notes:**
- The property must be defined first using `rei custom-property create`
- The property must be configured to apply to intentions
- Values are validated against the property definition (enum options, numeric ranges, etc.)
- Properties are displayed in `intention show` output

### clear-property

Remove a custom property from an intention.

```bash
rei intention clear-property [-i ID] PROPERTY_KEY
```

**Arguments:**
- `PROPERTY_KEY` — The key of the custom property to clear

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If `-i` is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Clear property with explicit ID
rei intention clear-property -i intention_01h455vb4pex priority

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention clear-property priority
```

### detach

Detach an intention from its parent, making it a root intention.

```bash
rei intention detach [id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from child intentions (those with parents).

**Examples:**

```bash
# Detach with explicit ID
rei intention detach intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention detach
```

**Notes:**
- Only Active and Future intentions can be detached
- The intention's children remain attached to it (hierarchy is preserved)
- After detaching, you can optionally set a context using `rei intention set-context`
- Useful when reorganizing your intention hierarchy

### note list

List notes attached to an intention, including notes on its actions, outcomes, and reflections.

```bash
rei intention note list [intention-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `-r, --recursive` — Include notes from all descendant intentions
- `--json` — Output as JSON

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# List notes for a specific intention
rei intention note list intention_01abc...

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention note list

# Include notes from child intentions
rei intention note list --recursive

# Output as JSON for scripting
rei intention note list intention_01abc... --json

# Combine recursive and JSON
rei intention note list --recursive --json
```

**Notes:**
- Shows notes attached directly to the intention plus notes on its actions, outcomes, and reflections
- Use `--recursive` to aggregate notes from the entire subtree of intentions
- JSON output is useful for scripting and integration
