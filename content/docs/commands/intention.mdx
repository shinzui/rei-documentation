Intentions are the core building blocks of rei, representing goals, projects, or commitments you want to accomplish.

## Intention Status

Intentions have one of four statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Currently being worked on. Shown in daily dashboard and reviews. |
| **Future** | Planned but not yet active. Hidden from today view until activated. |
| **Completed** | Successfully finished. Terminal state. |
| **Abandoned** | No longer pursuing. Terminal state with optional reason. |

**Lifecycle:**
- New intentions start as **Active** by default
- Use `--future` flag during creation for deferred intentions
- Use `defer` to move an Active intention to **Future** (defers children too)
- Use `activate` to move a Future intention back to **Active**
- Use `complete` or `abandon` for terminal states

## Subcommands

### create

Create a new intention.

```bash
rei intention create <title> [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<title>` — The title of the intention (use `-` to read from stdin)

**Options:**
- `-p, --parent <id>` — Parent intention ID (creates a sub-intention)
- `-h, --horizon <horizon>` — Time horizon (e.g., `1d`, `1w`, `1m`, `1y`)
- `-c, --context <context>` — Context label (e.g., `work`, `personal`)
- `--future` — Create as Future (deferred) instead of Active

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a top-level intention
rei intention create "Build personal website"

# Create a sub-intention
rei intention create "Design homepage" --parent intention_01h455vb4pex

# Create with a time horizon
rei intention create "Learn Haskell" --horizon 3m

# Create with context
rei intention create "Quarterly planning" --context work

# Create from stdin
echo "Write documentation" | rei intention create -

# Create as Future (deferred) intention
rei intention create "Plan vacation" --future

# Create a Future intention with horizon
rei intention create "Q2 project planning" --future --horizon 3m
```

**Notes:**
- Context can only be set on root intentions (those without a parent)
- Child intentions inherit context from their root ancestor
- Use `--future` to create intentions you want to plan now but activate later

### list

List intentions by status.

```bash
rei intention list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-f, --format <format>` — Output format: `default`, `fzf`, or `json`
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context
- `--future` — Show only Future (deferred) intentions
- `--all` — Show both Active and Future intentions

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default: list active intentions only
rei intention list

# List future intentions only
rei intention list --future

# List both active and future intentions
rei intention list --all

# Filter by context
rei intention list --context work

# Combine status and context filters
rei intention list --future --context work
```

### show

Show details of a specific intention.

```bash
rei intention show [id] [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--full` — Show full details including actions, outcomes, blockers, notes
- `--json` — Output as JSON (requires `--full`)

> **FZF Support:** If ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Full view includes:**
- Intention details (title, horizon, context, status)
- Recent actions taken (with associated notes, links, and docs)
- Recorded outcomes
- Active blockers
- Dependencies
- Supports (what this intention supports)
- Supported By (what supports this intention)
- Associated notes (with titles if available)
- Attached links and documents
- Child intentions

### tree

Show intention hierarchy as a tree.

```bash
rei intention tree [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-f, --future` — Show future intentions with their parent chains
- `-a, --all` — Show both active and future intentions with status indicators
- `--completed` — Show completed intentions with their parent chains
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default: show active intentions only
rei intention tree

# Show future intentions (with ancestor chains for context)
rei intention tree --future

# Show both active and future intentions
rei intention tree --all

# Show completed intentions (with ancestor chains for context)
rei intention tree --completed

# Filter by context
rei intention tree --context work

# Combine flags
rei intention tree --future --context personal
```

**Output:**
- Default view shows only active intentions in tree format
- `--future` shows future intentions with their active parent chains (future items highlighted in cyan)
- `--completed` shows completed intentions with their parent chains (completed items highlighted in green)
- `--all` shows active and future together, with `(future)` indicators on deferred items

### complete

Mark an intention as completed.

```bash
rei intention complete [id]
```

### abandon

Abandon an intention.

```bash
rei intention abandon [id] [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-r, --reason <reason>` — Optional reason for abandoning

**Notes:**
- Abandonment is a terminal state — abandoned intentions cannot be reactivated
- Recording a reason helps with future reflection on what didn't work

### defer

Move an intention to Future status.

```bash
rei intention defer [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Deferred intentions move to **Future** status and are hidden from daily views
- **Cascade behavior:** Deferring a parent automatically defers all active children
- Future intentions allow structural changes (parent, horizon, context) but block operational changes
- Use `activate` to bring a Future intention back to Active status

### activate

Move a Future intention back to Active.

```bash
rei intention activate [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Only Future intentions can be activated
- **Tree coherence:** Cannot activate an intention if its parent is still Future

### blocked

Show intentions that have unresolved blockers.

```bash
rei intention blocked [options]
```

### timeline

Show chronological event history for an intention.

```bash
rei intention timeline [id]
```

**Example output:**

```
Timeline: Learn Haskell

2024-12-01  Created
2024-12-01  Action: Set up development environment
2024-12-03  Action: Completed first tutorial
2024-12-05  Blocker: Can't understand monads
2024-12-07  Blocker resolved
2024-12-10  Outcome: Built first CLI tool
```

### get-help

Get AI-assisted help for an intention.

```bash
rei intention get-help [id]
```

Launches an interactive Claude Code session with full context about the intention.

**What it does:**
1. Gathers comprehensive context about the intention
2. Launches Claude Code interactively with research tools
3. Helps you make progress by analyzing blockers and suggesting next steps

### set-context / clear-context

Set or clear the context for a root intention.

```bash
rei intention set-context [id] <context>
rei intention clear-context [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Context can only be set on root intentions
- Child intentions and linked habits inherit context from the root

### contexts

List all contexts currently in use.

```bash
rei intention contexts
```

### set-horizon / clear-horizon

Set or clear the time horizon.

```bash
rei intention set-horizon [id] <horizon>
rei intention clear-horizon [id]
```

**Horizon formats:**
- `1d` — 1 day
- `1w` — 1 week
- `1m` — 1 month
- `1y` — 1 year
- Custom text like `"end of quarter"`

### guidance

Edit AI guidance for an intention (opens in $EDITOR).

```bash
rei intention guidance [id]
```

This opens your configured editor to edit custom guidance that the AI coach uses when reviewing this intention.

### remind

Create a reminder for an intention. This is a shortcut for `rei reminder create --intention`.

```bash
rei intention remind [intention-id] <description> --at <time>
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)
- `<description>` — Reminder description

**Options:**
- `-t, --at <time>` — When to trigger the reminder (required)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a reminder for tomorrow
rei intention remind intention_01abc... "Follow up on proposal" --at tomorrow

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention remind "Check progress" --at "1 week"
```

See [`rei reminder`](/docs/commands/reminder) for full reminder documentation.
