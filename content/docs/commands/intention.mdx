Intentions are the core building blocks of rei, representing goals, projects, or commitments you want to accomplish.

## Intention Status

Intentions have one of four statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Currently being worked on. Shown in daily dashboard and reviews. |
| **Future** | Planned but not yet active. Hidden from today view until activated. |
| **Completed** | Successfully finished. Terminal state. |
| **Abandoned** | No longer pursuing. Terminal state with optional reason. |

**Lifecycle:**
- New intentions start as **Active** by default
- Use `--future` flag during creation for deferred intentions
- Use `defer` to move an Active intention to **Future** (defers children too)
- Use `activate` to move a Future intention back to **Active**
- Use `complete` or `abandon` for terminal states

## Subcommands

### create

Create a new intention.

```bash
rei intention create <title> [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<title>` — The title of the intention (use `-` to read from stdin)

**Options:**
- `-p, --parent <id>` — Parent intention ID (creates a sub-intention)
- `-h, --horizon <horizon>` — Time horizon (e.g., `1d`, `1w`, `1m`, `1y`)
- `-c, --context <context>` — Context label (e.g., `work`, `personal`)
- `--future` — Create as Future (deferred) instead of Active

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a top-level intention
rei intention create "Build personal website"

# Create a sub-intention
rei intention create "Design homepage" --parent intention_01h455vb4pex

# Create with a time horizon
rei intention create "Learn Haskell" --horizon 3m

# Create with context
rei intention create "Quarterly planning" --context work

# Create from stdin
echo "Write documentation" | rei intention create -

# Create as Future (deferred) intention
rei intention create "Plan vacation" --future

# Create a Future intention with horizon
rei intention create "Q2 project planning" --future --horizon 3m
```

**Notes:**
- Context can only be set on root intentions (those without a parent)
- Child intentions inherit context from their root ancestor
- Use `--future` to create intentions you want to plan now but activate later

### list

List intentions by status.

```bash
rei intention list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-f, --format <format>` — Output format: `default`, `fzf`, or `json`
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context
- `--future` — Show only Future (deferred) intentions
- `--all` — Show both Active and Future intentions

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default: list active intentions only
rei intention list

# List future intentions only
rei intention list --future

# List both active and future intentions
rei intention list --all

# Filter by context
rei intention list --context work

# Combine status and context filters
rei intention list --future --context work
```

### show

Show details of a specific intention.

```bash
rei intention show [id] [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--full` — Show full details including actions, outcomes, blockers, notes
- `--json` — Output as JSON (requires `--full`)

> **FZF Support:** If ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Full view includes:**
- Intention details (title, horizon, context, status)
- **Overview Note** (designated entry-point note, if set)
- Recent actions taken (with associated notes, links, and docs)
- Recorded outcomes
- Active blockers
- Dependencies
- Supports (what this intention supports)
- Supported By (what supports this intention)
- Associated notes (with titles if available)
- Attached links and documents
- Tasks
- Linked habits
- Reminders (active and past, with status icons and scheduled times)
- Child intentions (both Active and Future; excludes Completed/Abandoned)

### tree

Show intention hierarchy as a tree.

```bash
rei intention tree [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-f, --future` — Show future intentions with their parent chains
- `-a, --all` — Show both active and future intentions with status indicators
- `--completed` — Show completed intentions with their parent chains
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context
- `--tui` — Launch interactive TUI for browsing the hierarchy

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default: show active intentions only
rei intention tree

# Show future intentions (with ancestor chains for context)
rei intention tree --future

# Show both active and future intentions
rei intention tree --all

# Show completed intentions (with ancestor chains for context)
rei intention tree --completed

# Filter by context
rei intention tree --context work

# Combine flags
rei intention tree --future --context personal

# Launch interactive TUI
rei intention tree --tui
```

**Output:**
- Default view shows only active intentions in tree format
- `--future` shows future intentions with their active parent chains (future items highlighted in cyan)
- `--completed` shows completed intentions with their parent chains (completed items highlighted in green)
- `--all` shows active and future together, with `(future)` indicators on deferred items

**Interactive TUI Mode:**

The `--tui` flag launches an interactive terminal UI for browsing the intention hierarchy:

- **Navigation**: Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to move up/down
- **View details**: Press `Enter` to open the full detail view for an intention
- **Open notes**: In detail view, press `o` to open notes (FZF picker if multiple)
- **Close views**: Press `Esc` to close detail view or quit
- **Quit**: Press `q` to exit

The TUI works with all tree variants (active, future, completed, all) and respects context filtering.

### complete

Mark an intention as completed.

```bash
rei intention complete [id]
```

### abandon

Abandon an intention.

```bash
rei intention abandon [id] [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-r, --reason <reason>` — Optional reason for abandoning

**Notes:**
- Abandonment is a terminal state — abandoned intentions cannot be reactivated
- Recording a reason helps with future reflection on what didn't work

### defer

Move an intention to Future status.

```bash
rei intention defer [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Deferred intentions move to **Future** status and are hidden from daily views
- **Cascade behavior:** Deferring a parent automatically defers all active children
- Future intentions allow structural changes (parent, horizon, context) but block operational changes
- Use `activate` to bring a Future intention back to Active status

### activate

Move a Future intention back to Active.

```bash
rei intention activate [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Only Future intentions can be activated
- **Tree coherence:** Cannot activate an intention if its parent is still Future

### blocked

Show intentions that have unresolved blockers.

```bash
rei intention blocked [options]
```

### timeline

Show chronological event history for an intention.

```bash
rei intention timeline [id]
```

**Example output:**

```
Timeline: Learn Haskell

2024-12-01  Created
2024-12-01  Action: Set up development environment
2024-12-03  Action: Completed first tutorial
2024-12-05  Blocker: Can't understand monads
2024-12-07  Blocker resolved
2024-12-10  Outcome: Built first CLI tool
```

### get-help

Get AI-assisted help for an intention.

```bash
rei intention get-help [id]
```

Launches an interactive Claude Code session with full context about the intention.

**What it does:**
1. Gathers comprehensive context about the intention
2. Launches Claude Code interactively with research tools
3. Helps you make progress by analyzing blockers and suggesting next steps

### set-context / clear-context

Set or clear the context for a root intention.

```bash
rei intention set-context [id] <context>
rei intention clear-context [id]
```

**Notes:**
- Context can only be set on root intentions
- Child intentions and linked habits inherit context from the root

### contexts

List all contexts currently in use.

```bash
rei intention contexts
```

### set-horizon / clear-horizon

Set or clear the time horizon.

```bash
rei intention set-horizon [id] <horizon>
rei intention clear-horizon [id]
```

**Horizon formats:**
- `1d` — 1 day
- `1w` — 1 week
- `1m` — 1 month
- `1y` — 1 year
- Custom text like `"end of quarter"`

### guidance

Edit AI guidance for an intention (opens in $EDITOR).

```bash
rei intention guidance [id]
```

This opens your configured editor to edit custom guidance that the AI coach uses when reviewing this intention.

### set-category

Assign a category to an intention. Categories help classify and organize intentions for filtering and reporting.

```bash
rei intention set-category [-i ID] CATEGORY_SLUG
```

**Arguments:**
- `CATEGORY_SLUG` — Category slug (e.g., 'work', 'personal/health')

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If `-i` is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set category with explicit ID
rei intention set-category -i intention_01h455vb4pex work

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention set-category work
```

**Notes:**
- Categories are different from contexts: contexts are for root intention grouping while categories are a flexible classification system
- Categories can be hierarchical (e.g., `work/meeting`)

### clear-category

Remove the category from an intention.

```bash
rei intention clear-category [id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Clear category with explicit ID
rei intention clear-category intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention clear-category
```

### remind

Create a reminder for an intention. This is a shortcut for `rei reminder create --intention`.

```bash
rei intention remind [intention-id] <description> --at <time>
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)
- `<description>` — Reminder description

**Options:**
- `-t, --at <time>` — When to trigger the reminder (required)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a reminder for tomorrow
rei intention remind intention_01abc... "Follow up on proposal" --at tomorrow

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention remind "Check progress" --at "1 week"
```

See [`rei reminder`](/docs/commands/reminder) for full reminder documentation.

### set-overview

Designate a note as the overview note for an intention. The overview note serves as an entry point providing summary or context, and is displayed prominently in `show --full` output.

```bash
rei intention set-overview [intention-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `-n, --note <note-id>` — Note ID to set as overview (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If IDs are not provided, interactive pickers will let you select from active intentions and their associated notes.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set with explicit IDs
rei intention set-overview intention_01abc... --note note_01xyz...

# Let fzf pick both
rei intention set-overview
```

**Notes:**
- The note must be anchored to the target intention (not a different intention or a habit)
- Only one note can be the overview at a time; setting a new one replaces the previous
- Overview notes appear in a dedicated "Overview Note" section in `intention show --full`

### clear-overview

Remove the overview note designation from an intention.

```bash
rei intention clear-overview [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Clear with explicit ID
rei intention clear-overview intention_01abc...

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention clear-overview
```

### set-note-guidance

Set AI guidance for notes under an intention. This guidance is automatically included when getting help with any note anchored to this intention.

```bash
rei intention set-note-guidance [intention-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `--content <text>` — Guidance content (optional, opens $EDITOR if not provided)
- `--stdin` — Read guidance from stdin

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Open editor to write guidance
rei intention set-note-guidance intention_01abc...

# Set guidance directly
rei intention set-note-guidance intention_01abc... --content "Focus on practical examples"

# Pipe guidance from file
cat guidance.md | rei intention set-note-guidance intention_01abc... --stdin
```

**Use Case:**

When you have multiple notes under an intention that all need similar help context (e.g., "focus on practical examples" or "use simple language"), set note guidance once on the intention rather than repeating `--focus` on every `note get-help` call.

### show-note-guidance

Show the current note guidance for an intention.

```bash
rei intention show-note-guidance [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show with explicit ID
rei intention show-note-guidance intention_01abc...

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention show-note-guidance
```

### clear-note-guidance

Remove note guidance from an intention.

```bash
rei intention clear-note-guidance [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Clear with explicit ID
rei intention clear-note-guidance intention_01abc...

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention clear-note-guidance
```

### tracker

Show a visual activity tracker for an intention. Displays action frequency over time in either calendar or heatmap style.

```bash
rei intention tracker [id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `-d, --days <n>` — Number of days to show (default: 90)
- `-s, --style <style>` — Display style: `calendar` (default) or `heatmap`
- `--include-children` — Include actions from child intentions

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Display Styles:**

**calendar** (default) — Shows a week-by-week calendar with intensity levels:
```
Activity Tracker: Build personal website (90 days)

Dec 30-05  ·  ·  ●  ○  ·  ·  ·
Jan 06-12  ○  ·  ○  ◉  ○  ·  ·
Jan 13-19  ·  ·  ○  ·  ·  ·  ·

Legend: · (none)  ○ (1-2)  ● (3-4)  ◉ (5+)
```

**heatmap** — GitHub-style contribution graph using colored blocks:
```
Activity Tracker: Build personal website (90 days)
Actions: 23 in 90 days (avg 0.3/day)

[GitHub-style heatmap visualization]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show tracker with default settings (90 days, calendar style)
rei intention tracker intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention
rei intention tracker

# Show last 30 days
rei intention tracker -d 30

# Use heatmap visualization
rei intention tracker --style heatmap

# Include child intention actions
rei intention tracker --include-children

# Combine options
rei intention tracker -d 180 --style heatmap --include-children
```

**Notes:**
- The tracker aggregates all actions recorded for the intention
- `--include-children` recursively includes actions from all descendant intentions
- Useful for visualizing work patterns and maintaining consistency
