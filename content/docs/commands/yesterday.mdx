```

**Options:**

## Dashboard Sections

The yesterday review displays the following sections:

### Cycle Context

If yesterday was part of an active focus cycle, shows:
- Cycle name and progress (e.g., "Day 4/14")
- Yesterday's designated focus area (if set)
- "No focus was set for yesterday" if no focus was selected

### Completed Yesterday

Intentions that were completed yesterday, either:
- **Grouped by context** (when no filter applied) — organized under context headers
- **Flat list** (when filtered by `-c`) — showing only matching intentions

Each completed intention shows its active days count (e.g., "[5d]").

### Actions Taken

All actions recorded yesterday:
- Timestamp and description
- Duration (if recorded)
- Energy polarity indicator (if set)
- Attached notes listed below each action

Shows total count (e.g., "3 action(s) recorded").

### Outcomes Recorded

### Habits (Scheduled)

Habits that were scheduled for yesterday:
- Completion status icon (checkmark or X)
- Habit name
- Action count if multiple (e.g., "(2x)")
- Status: "(done)" or "(missed)"

Shows completion rate summary (e.g., "3/5 completed").

### Flexible Habits

Habits with flexible schedules (FreeWeekly, FreeMonthly, etc.) showing:
- Progress indicator for the period (e.g., "2/3 this week")
- Days performed in the period (e.g., "Mon, Wed")
- Status: "(done)" if performed yesterday, "(missed)" otherwise

### Reflections Performed

Reflections completed yesterday with their type and completion time:
- Daily Review, Weekly Review, etc.

## Examples

# Review yesterday
rei yesterday

# Review yesterday for work context only
rei yesterday --context work
rei yesterday -c work
```

## Use Cases

### Morning Review

Start your day by reviewing what you accomplished yesterday:

```bash
rei yesterday
```

This helps you:
- See which habits you completed or missed
- Review actions taken and their outcomes
- Note which intentions were completed
- Build on momentum from the previous day

### Context-Specific Review

Focus on a specific life area:

```bash
rei yesterday --context work
```

### Stand-up Preparation

Use before daily stand-ups to recall what you did:

```bash
rei yesterday -c work
```

## Comparison with `rei review day`

| Feature | `rei yesterday` | `rei review day` |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Date | Always yesterday | Any date (defaults to yesterday) |
| Shorthand | Yes (quick access) | No (requires subcommand) |
| Date argument | No | Yes (`rei review day 2025-01-15`) |

Both commands show the same data structure. Use `rei yesterday` for quick access to the previous day, or `rei review day [DATE]` when you need to review a specific date.

## Notes

- Times are displayed in your local timezone
- The command requires a database backend (PostgreSQL)
- Context filtering shows data whose root ancestor has the matching context
- Habit completion is determined by whether any actions were recorded for the habit on that day
