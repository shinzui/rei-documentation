Manage blockers for intentions and habits. Blockers represent obstacles or things preventing progress.

## Subcommands

### declare

Declare a new blocker for an intention or habit.

```bash
rei blocker declare [description] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[description]` — Description of the blocker (optional, can be provided via stdin)

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)
- `--habit <id>` — Habit ID (for habit blockers instead of intention blockers)
- `--actor <actor>` — Actor performing this action (overrides global `--actor`)

> **FZF Support:** If neither `-i` nor `--habit` is provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Declare a blocker on an intention with explicit ID
rei blocker declare -i intention_01h455vb4pex "Waiting for API credentials"

# Let fzf pick the intention interactively
rei blocker declare "Waiting for API credentials"

# Declare a blocker on a habit (auto-pauses the habit)
rei blocker declare --habit habit_01abc... "Gym is closed for renovation"

# Declare via stdin
echo "Need to learn GraphQL before proceeding" | rei blocker declare -i intention_01h455vb4pex
```

**Notes:**
- Habit blockers automatically pause the habit when declared
- Cannot specify both `--intention` and `--habit` at the same time

### resolve

Resolve (remove) a blocker.

```bash
rei blocker resolve [blocker-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[blocker-id]` — Blocker ID (optional if fzf is available)

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)
- `--habit <id>` — Habit ID (for habit blockers instead of intention blockers)
- `--actor <actor>` — Actor performing this action (overrides global `--actor`)

> **FZF Support:** If IDs are not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from intentions/habits with blockers, then select the blocker.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Resolve intention blocker with explicit IDs
rei blocker resolve blocker_01h455vb4pex -i intention_01h455vb4pex

# Let fzf pick the intention and blocker
rei blocker resolve

# Resolve a habit blocker (auto-resumes habit if last blocker)
rei blocker resolve --habit habit_01abc... blocker_01xyz...

# Let fzf pick habit with blockers, then pick blocker
rei blocker resolve --habit
```

**Notes:**
- When the last blocker on a habit is resolved, the habit automatically resumes
- Cannot specify both `--intention` and `--habit` at the same time

### list

List all active blockers.

```bash
rei blocker list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--intentions` — Show only intention blockers
- `--habits` — Show only habit blockers

**Examples:**

```bash
# List all active blockers (intentions and habits)
rei blocker list

# List only intention blockers
rei blocker list --intentions

# List only habit blockers
rei blocker list --habits
```

**Output:**

When showing all blockers:
```
=== Intention Blockers ===
  • blocker_01abc...
    Intention: Learn GraphQL
    Waiting for course access

=== Habit Blockers ===
  • blocker_01xyz...
    Habit: Morning Gym
    Gym closed for renovation
```

## Habit Blocker Behavior

Habit blockers have automatic pause/resume behavior:

1. **Auto-pause:** When a blocker is declared on an active habit, the habit is automatically paused
2. **Auto-resume:** When the last blocker is resolved, the habit automatically resumes

This means you don't need to manually pause/resume habits when blockers are involved.

## Viewing Blocked Intentions

See all intentions with blockers:

```bash
rei intention blocked
```

This helps you identify what's stuck and why.
