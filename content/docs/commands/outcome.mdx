Outcomes record observable evidence that something changed. Unlike actions (which track effort), outcomes track results.

## Subcommands

### record

Record an outcome for an intention.

```bash
rei outcome record [description] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[description]` — Description of the outcome (optional, can be provided via stdin)

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)
- `-t, --at <time>` — When the outcome was achieved (optional, defaults to now)

> **FZF Support:** If `-i` is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Relative Time:**

The `--at` option accepts human-readable relative time expressions:
- Keywords: `now`, `today`, `yesterday`, `tomorrow`
- Natural expressions: `2 hours ago`, `30 minutes ago`, `1 day ago`
- Short forms: `-2h`, `-30m`, `-1d`, `2h`, `30m`
- ISO 8601: `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z`, `2024-01-15T14:30:00+09:00`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Record an outcome with explicit intention
rei outcome record -i intention_01h455vb4pex "Deployed to production successfully"

# Let fzf pick the intention interactively
rei outcome record "Deployed to production successfully"

# Record via stdin
echo "All tests passing, 95% coverage" | rei outcome record -i intention_01h455vb4pex

# Record an outcome that happened 2 hours ago
rei outcome record "Feature approved by client" --at "2 hours ago"

# Record yesterday's outcome
rei outcome record -i intention_01abc... "Milestone completed" -t yesterday
```

## Actions vs Outcomes

| Actions | Outcomes |
|---------|----------|
| What you did | What changed |
| Effort | Results |
| "Wrote for 30 minutes" | "Published blog post" |
| Process | Evidence |

Both are valuable:
- Actions track your investment of time and energy
- Outcomes track the results of that investment

## Viewing Outcomes

Outcomes appear in:
- `rei intention show --full` — When viewing an intention
- `rei intention timeline` — Chronological history
- Weekly reviews
