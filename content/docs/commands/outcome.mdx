Outcomes record observable evidence that something changed. Unlike actions (which track effort), outcomes track results.

## Subcommands

### record

Record an outcome for an intention.

```bash
rei outcome record <intention-id> <description>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<intention-id>` — The intention this outcome belongs to
- `<description>` — What evidence of progress you observed

**Examples:**

```bash
# Record publishing a blog post
rei outcome record intention_01h455vb4pex "Published first blog post"

# Record a milestone
rei outcome record intention_01h455vb4pex "Reached 1000 words in draft"

# Record external validation
rei outcome record intention_01h455vb4pex "Received positive feedback from reader"
```

## Actions vs Outcomes

| Actions | Outcomes |
|---------|----------|
| What you did | What changed |
| Effort | Results |
| "Wrote for 30 minutes" | "Published blog post" |
| Process | Evidence |

Both are valuable:
- Actions track your investment of time and energy
- Outcomes track the results of that investment

## Viewing Outcomes

Outcomes appear in:
- `rei intention show --full` — When viewing an intention
- `rei intention timeline` — Chronological history
- Weekly reviews
