Manage tasks discovered from notes and markdown files. Tasks are extracted from checkbox items (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) in notes attached to intentions, actions, outcomes, and reflections.

## Subcommands

### list

List tasks for an entity.

```bash
rei task list [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-i, --intention <id>` — List tasks for an intention
- `-a, --action <id>` — List tasks for an action
- `-o, --outcome <id>` — List tasks for an outcome
- `-r, --reflection <id>` — List tasks for a reflection
- `--all` — List all tasks across all entities (makes entity selection optional)
- `--include-completed` — Include completed tasks in output
- `--due-before <date>` — Filter tasks due before DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `--due-after <date>` — Filter tasks due after DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `--due-today` — Show only tasks due today
- `--overdue` — Show only overdue tasks
- `--sort-due` — Sort by due date (earliest first)

> **FZF Support:** If no entity ID is provided and `--all` is not specified, an interactive picker will let you select from available entities.

**Examples:**

```bash
# List tasks for an intention
rei task list -i intention_01abc...

# List tasks including completed ones
rei task list -i intention_01abc... --include-completed

# List all tasks across all entities
rei task list --all

# List all tasks including completed
rei task list --all --include-completed

# Show tasks due today
rei task list --due-today

# Show all overdue tasks sorted by due date
rei task list --all --overdue --sort-due

# Show tasks due before a specific date
rei task list --due-before 2026-01-15

# Interactive selection with fzf
rei task list
```

**Output:**
- Pending tasks shown with `[ ]`
- Completed tasks shown with `[x]`
- Due date indicators: `[OVERDUE Nd]`, `[DUE TODAY]`, `[DUE TOMORROW]`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set due date to specific date
rei task due task_01abc... 2026-01-15

# Set due date to tomorrow
rei task due task_01abc... tomorrow

# Set due date to 3 days from now
rei task due task_01abc... +3d

# Set due date to 2 weeks from now

# Clear the due date
rei task due task_01abc... --clear
```

## How Tasks Work

Tasks are automatically discovered when you:
1. Create or update a note attached to an entity (intention, action, outcome, reflection)
2. The note contains markdown checkbox items

**Checkbox syntax:**

```markdown
- [ ] This is a pending task
- [x] This is a completed task
```

When you complete/reopen a task via the CLI, Rei automatically updates the checkbox in the original markdown file(s).

## Due Date Display

When listing tasks, due dates are displayed with helpful indicators:

| Status | Display |
|--------|---------|
| Overdue by N days | `[OVERDUE Nd]` (highlighted) |
| Due today | `[DUE TODAY]` |
| Due tomorrow | `[DUE TOMORROW]` |
| Future due date | Shows date only |

Completed tasks don't show overdue indicators.
