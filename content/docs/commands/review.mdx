Display review summaries for analyzing your progress over time periods.

## Subcommands

### week

Show a weekly review summary for the current week (Monday to Sunday).

```bash
rei review week [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context (e.g., `work`, `personal`)

## Weekly Review Sections

The weekly review displays the following sections:

### Header

Shows the week's date range (e.g., "Week of January 13-19, 2025") and context filter if applied.

### Intentions

Summary statistics:
- **Active** — Number of currently active intentions
- **Completed this week** — Intentions that reached completion status during the week

### Actions

Action statistics:
- **Total** — Total number of actions recorded during the week
- **By intention** — Breakdown showing which intentions received the most attention

When no context filter is applied, actions are grouped by context with the top 3 intentions per context shown. When filtered, a flat list of the top 5 intentions is displayed.

### Outcomes

List of outcomes recorded during the week. Outcomes represent completed milestones or deliverables.

### Habit Adherence

Shows completion rates for each active habit:
- Completion count vs. scheduled days (e.g., "5/7")
- Percentage with color coding:
  - Green: 80%+ adherence
  - Yellow: 50-79% adherence
  - Red: Below 50% adherence

When no context filter is applied, habits are grouped by context.

### Blockers

Count of currently active blockers.

### Reflections

Summary of reflection activity:
- **Completed** — Number of reflections completed during the week
- **Skipped** — Number of reflections that were skipped

## Examples

```bash
# Show weekly review for current week
rei review week

# Filter to work context only
rei review week --context work

# Filter to personal context
rei review week -c personal
```

## Notes

- The week is calculated as Monday through Sunday
- Context filtering applies to:
  - Intentions (via root ancestor context)
  - Actions (via their intention's context)
  - Habits (linked habits use intention context, unlinked use their own context)
  - Reflections (via their own context field)
- The review requires a database backend (PostgreSQL)
- Actions from intentions completed before the week (but with actions during the week) are included in statistics
