**Options:**

- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context (e.g., `work`, `personal`)

#### Day Review Sections

The day review displays:

- **Header** — Date with day name and relative indicator (e.g., "Wednesday, 2025-01-15 (3 days ago)")
- **Cycle Context** — Shows the cycle name, day number, and that day's focus (if set)
- **Completed** — Intentions completed on that day, grouped by context
- **Actions Taken** — All actions recorded with timestamps, durations, and attached notes
- **Outcomes Recorded** — Outcomes recorded on that day
- **Habits (Scheduled)** — Habits scheduled for that day with completion status
- **Reflections Performed** — Reflections completed on that day

#### Examples

```bash
# Review yesterday (default)
rei review day

# Review a specific date
rei review day 2025-01-15

# Review with explicit date flag
rei review day --date 2025-01-15

# Review with context filter
rei review day -c work

# Combine date and context filter
rei review day 2025-01-10 -c personal
```

### week

Show a weekly review summary for the current week (Monday to Sunday).

```bash
rei review week [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context (e.g., `work`, `personal`)

## Weekly Review Sections

The weekly review displays the following sections:

### Header

Shows the week's date range (e.g., "Week of January 13-19, 2025") and context filter if applied.

### Intentions

Summary statistics:
- **Active** — Number of currently active intentions
- **Completed this week** — Intentions that reached completion status during the week

### Actions

Action statistics:
- **Total** — Total number of actions recorded during the week
- **By intention** — Breakdown showing which intentions received the most attention

When no context filter is applied, actions are grouped by context with the top 3 intentions per context shown. When filtered, a flat list of the top 5 intentions is displayed.

### Outcomes

List of outcomes recorded during the week. Outcomes represent completed milestones or deliverables.

### Habit Adherence

Shows completion rates for each active habit:
- Completion count vs. scheduled days (e.g., "5/7")
- Percentage with color coding:
  - Green: 80%+ adherence
  - Yellow: 50-79% adherence
  - Red: Below 50% adherence

When no context filter is applied, habits are grouped by context.

### Blockers

Count of currently active blockers.

### Disruptions

Shows disruptions that occurred during the week (filtered by `lastOccurredAt`):
- **Status counts** — Active, Addressed, and Resolved disruption counts
- **Items** — Listed with status icon, source name, instance count, and total duration

Status icons:
- 🔴 (red circle) — Active
- ◐ (half circle, yellow) — Addressed
- ✓ (green check) — Resolved

When no context filter is applied, disruptions are grouped by context. When filtered, a flat list is shown.

### Reflections

Summary of reflection activity:
- **Completed** — Number of reflections completed during the week
- **Skipped** — Number of reflections that were skipped

## Examples

```bash
# Show weekly review for current week
rei review week

# Filter to work context only
rei review week --context work

# Filter to personal context
rei review week -c personal
```

## Notes

- The week is calculated as Monday through Sunday
- Context filtering applies to:
  - Intentions (via root ancestor context)
  - Actions (via their intention's context)
  - Habits (linked habits use intention context, unlinked use their own context)
  - Disruptions (via their own context field)
  - Reflections (via their own context field)
- The review requires a database backend (PostgreSQL)
- Actions from intentions completed before the week (but with actions during the week) are included in statistics
