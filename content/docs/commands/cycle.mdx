Manage focus cycles. A cycle is a bounded time period for tracking daily focus selections.

## Subcommands

### start

Start a new cycle.

```bash
rei cycle start [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-l, --length <days>` — Cycle length in days (required)
- `-n, --name <name>` — Optional name for the cycle
- `-d, --start-date <date>` — Start date (defaults to today, format: YYYY-MM-DD)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Start a 10-day cycle
rei cycle start --length 10

# Start a named 7-day cycle
rei cycle start --length 7 --name "Week 1"

# Start a cycle with a specific start date
rei cycle start --length 10 --start-date 2025-01-01
```

**Notes:**
- Only one cycle can be active at a time
- Starting a new cycle when one is active will fail

### status

Show the status of the active cycle.

```bash
rei cycle status
```

**Output:**

```
Active Cycle:
  ID: cycle_01abc...
  Start: 2025-01-01
  End: 2025-01-10
  Length: 10 days
  Progress: 3/10 days with focus selected

Daily Focus Selections:
  2025-01-01: focus_01abc... (Connect)
  2025-01-02: focus_01def... (Study)
  2025-01-03: focus_01ghi... (Create)
```

### select-focus

Select a focus for today (or change a previous day's selection).

```bash
rei cycle select-focus [focus-id] [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[focus-id]` — Focus ID (optional, interactive selection if omitted)

**Options:**
- `-d, --date <date>` — Date to set focus for (defaults to today, format: YYYY-MM-DD)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive selection for today
rei cycle select-focus

# Direct selection for today
rei cycle select-focus focus_01abc...

# Set focus for a past date
rei cycle select-focus focus_01abc... --date 2025-01-01
```

**Notes:**
- Can only select focus for dates within the cycle bounds
- Can only select focus for today or past dates (no future planning)
- Selecting a new focus for a date that already has one will change it

### complete

Mark the active cycle as completed.

```bash
rei cycle complete
```

**Notes:**
- Completed cycles are terminal — they cannot be modified
- You can complete a cycle before all days have focus selections

### abandon

Abandon the active cycle.

```bash
rei cycle abandon
```

**Notes:**
- Abandoned cycles are terminal — they cannot be modified
- Use this when you want to start fresh without completing the current cycle

### list

List all cycles.

```bash
rei cycle list
```

**Output:**

```
Cycles (3):

  [*] 2025-01-11 - 2025-01-20 (cycle_01xyz...)
  [✓] 2025-01-01 - 2025-01-10 (cycle_01abc...)
  [x] "Failed Attempt" 2024-12-20 - 2024-12-29 (cycle_01def...)
```

Status indicators:
- `[*]` — Active
- `[✓]` — Completed
- `[x]` — Abandoned

### show

Show details of a specific cycle.

```bash
rei cycle show <cycle-id>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<cycle-id>` — Cycle ID (required)

**Output:**

```
Cycle: cycle_01abc...
  Name: Week 1
  Status: Completed
  Start: 2025-01-01
  End: 2025-01-07
  Length: 7 days
  Days with focus: 7/7
  Created: 2025-01-01 08:00:00 UTC
  Completed: 2025-01-07 22:00:00 UTC

Daily Focus Selections:
  2025-01-01: focus_01abc... (Connect)
  2025-01-02: focus_01def... (Study)
  ...
```

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Set up focus areas (one-time)
rei focus import anatomy-of-equanimity

# 2. Start a cycle
rei cycle start --length 10 --name "January Cycle"

# 3. Each day, select your focus
rei cycle select-focus

# 4. Check your progress
rei cycle status

# 5. At the end, complete the cycle
rei cycle complete

# 6. Start a new cycle
rei cycle start --length 10
```

## Integration with Focus Areas

Cycles work with focus areas to track daily time allocation:

- Focus areas define *what* categories of activity exist
- Cycles define *when* you're tracking (bounded time periods)
- Daily selections record *which* focus you chose each day

This creates a rhythm of intentional daily focus without rigid scheduling.
