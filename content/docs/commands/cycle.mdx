Cycles are bounded time periods (typically a day) for tracking which focus areas you engaged with.

## Subcommands

### start

Start a new cycle for today.

```bash
rei cycle start
```

### status

Show current cycle status.

```bash
rei cycle status
```

Shows:
- Whether a cycle is active
- Which focus areas have been selected
- Time remaining in the cycle

### select-focus

Select a focus area for the current cycle.

```bash
rei cycle select-focus [focus-id]
```

Records that you engaged with this focus area today.

### complete

Complete the current cycle.

```bash
rei cycle complete
```

Marks the cycle as successfully finished.

### abandon

Abandon the current cycle.

```bash
rei cycle abandon
```

Use when the day didn't go as planned and tracking isn't meaningful.

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# Morning: start the day
rei cycle start

# Throughout the day: record focus areas
rei cycle select-focus <focus-id>

# End of day: complete the cycle
rei cycle complete
```
