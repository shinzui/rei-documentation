description: Preview tomorrow's dashboard for planning ahead

Preview tomorrow's dashboard for planning the night before. Similar to `rei today` but shows what you'll face tomorrow, helping you prepare and plan ahead.

```bash
rei tomorrow [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context (e.g., `work`, `personal`)

## Dashboard Sections

The tomorrow preview displays the following sections:

### Active Cycle & Focus

If you have an active focus cycle, shows:
- Cycle name and progress (e.g., "Day 4/14, 10 days remaining")
- Tomorrow's designated focus area (if already set)
- "No focus set for tomorrow" if you haven't selected yet

### Active Intentions

Your active intentions that will carry into tomorrow, either:
- **Grouped by context** (when no filter applied) — organized under context headers like "work", "personal"
- **Flat list** (when filtered by `-c`) — showing only matching intentions

Each intention shows a "(blocked)" indicator if it has unresolved blockers.

### Tasks

Tasks organized by their status relative to tomorrow:
- **Overdue** — Tasks already past due (shown in red with days overdue)
- **Due Tomorrow** — Tasks due on that day (shown in yellow)
- **Upcoming** — Tasks due within 7 days after tomorrow

### Blockers

Active blockers with age indicator showing how old they'll be tomorrow (e.g., "3 days").

### Habits

Habits scheduled for tomorrow's day of week:
- Daily habits always appear
- Weekly habits appear on their scheduled day
- Shows pending status (no completion tracking for future days)

### Pending Reflections

Reflections that are scheduled but not yet completed.

## Examples

```bash
# Preview tomorrow's dashboard
rei tomorrow

# Preview tomorrow for work context only
rei tomorrow --context work
rei tomorrow -c work
```

## Use Cases

### Evening Planning

Review tomorrow's commitments before ending your day:

```bash
rei tomorrow
```

This helps you:
- See what blockers are aging and need attention
- Check which habits are scheduled
- Identify overdue tasks that will carry forward
- Plan your focus area for the cycle

### Context-Specific Planning

Focus on a specific life area:

```bash
rei tomorrow --context work
```

## Comparison with `rei today`

| Feature | `rei today` | `rei tomorrow` |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Shows current day | Yes | No |
| Shows future day | No | Yes (tomorrow) |
| Today's actions | Yes | No |
| Triggered reminders | Yes | No |
| Completed today | Yes | No |
| Habit completion status | Yes | No (all pending) |
| Task due calculation | Relative to today | Relative to tomorrow |
| Blocker age | As of today | As of tomorrow |
| TUI mode | Yes (`--tui`) | No |
| Include dormant | Yes (`--include-dormant`) | No |

## Notes

- Times and dates are calculated based on your local timezone
- The dashboard requires a database backend (PostgreSQL)
- Context filtering shows intentions whose root ancestor has the matching context
- Linked habits inherit context from their linked intention
- Blocker ages are calculated as of tomorrow, so a blocker declared today shows as "1 day"
