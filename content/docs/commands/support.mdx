Manage support relationships between intentions. Support relationships indicate that one intention helps or enables another, without creating a strict dependency.

## Concept

Unlike dependencies (which block progress), supports are informational relationships that help you understand how your intentions relate to each other. For example:
- "Learn Haskell" **supports** "Build personal website" (learning helps but doesn't block)
- "Exercise regularly" **supports** "Improve focus at work"

Support relationships appear in the `intention show --full` output under "Supports" and "Supported By" sections.

## Subcommands

### add

Add a support relationship between two intentions.

```bash
rei support add [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-f, --from <id>` — The supporting intention (uses FZF if not provided)
- `-t, --to <id>` — The intention being supported (uses FZF if not provided)
- `-n, --note <text>` — Optional description of the support relationship
- `-a, --actor <actor>` — Actor that created this entity (e.g., `claude-code`, `user`)

> **FZF Support:** If `--from` or `--to` are not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, interactive pickers will let you select intentions.
>
> **Interactive Toggle:** Press `ctrl-f` in the FZF picker to toggle between viewing only active intentions and viewing all intentions (active + future). This lets you quickly find future intentions without restarting the command.

**Valid Intentions:**

Support relationships can be declared on both **Active** and **Future** intentions. This allows you to plan support relationships for work you haven't started yet. Completed and Abandoned intentions cannot have supports added.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add support with explicit IDs
rei support add --from intention_abc123 --to intention_def456

# Add support with a note
rei support add --from intention_abc123 --to intention_def456 --note "Learning enables implementation"

# Let FZF guide selection
rei support add
```

**Notes:**
- An intention cannot support itself
- Both intentions must exist
- The support relationship is directional: "from" supports "to"

### remove

Remove a support relationship.

```bash
rei support remove [options] <support-id>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<support-id>` — The support ID to remove (required)

**Options:**
- `-f, --from <id>` — The supporting intention (uses FZF if not provided)

> **FZF Support:** If `--from` is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select the supporting intention.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Remove with explicit IDs
rei support remove --from intention_abc123 support_xyz789

# Let FZF select the intention
rei support remove support_xyz789
```

### show

Show what an intention supports (outgoing support relationships).

```bash
rei support show [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show with explicit ID
rei support show intention_abc123

# Let FZF pick the intention
rei support show
```

**Output:**

```
What intention_abc123 supports:
  → intention_def456
    ID: support_xyz789
    Note: Learning enables implementation
    Declared: 2026-01-09 10:30:00
```

### supported-by

Show what supports an intention (incoming support relationships).

```bash
rei support supported-by [intention-id]
```

**Arguments:**
- `[intention-id]` — Intention ID (optional if fzf is available)

> **FZF Support:** If the ID is not provided and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed, an interactive picker will let you select from active intentions.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show with explicit ID
rei support supported-by intention_def456

# Let FZF pick the intention
rei support supported-by
```

**Output:**

```
What supports intention_def456:
  ← intention_abc123
    ID: support_xyz789
    Note: Learning enables implementation
    Declared: 2026-01-09 10:30:00
```

## Viewing Supports in Intention Details

Support relationships also appear when viewing intention details with `--full`:

```bash
rei intention show intention_abc123 --full
```

The output includes:

```
─── Supports ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  -> Build personal website - Learning enables implementation

─── Supported By ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  <- Study functional programming
```
