Find intentions that haven't had any recorded actions in a specified number of days. This helps identify goals that may need attention or should be reconsidered.

```bash
rei neglected [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-d, --days <days>` — Number of days without activity to consider neglected (default: 10)
- `-c, --context <context>` — Filter by context (e.g., `work`, `personal`)

## Output

The command displays neglected intentions with:
- **Age indicator** — Days since last activity, or "never" if no actions have been recorded
- **Grouped by context** — When no filter is applied, intentions are organized under context headers
- **Flat list** — When filtered by `-c`, shows only matching intentions

### Color-Coded Severity

The age indicator is color-coded based on inactivity duration:

| Duration | Color | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 10-29 days | Yellow | Needs attention |
| 30+ days | Red | Severely neglected |
| Never | Red | No activity ever recorded |

## Examples

```bash
# Find intentions with no activity in 10+ days (default)
rei neglected

# Find intentions with no activity in 30+ days
rei neglected --days 30

# Filter to work context only
rei neglected --context work

# Find personal intentions neglected for 2+ weeks
rei neglected --days 14 --context personal
```

## Sample Output

```
Neglected Intentions (no activity in 10+ days)

▸ work
  15 days: Refactor authentication module
  never: Document API endpoints

▸ personal
  12 days: Organize photo library

Total: 3 neglected intention(s)
```

## Use Cases

- **Weekly reviews** — Check for intentions that have stalled during your weekly review
- **Intention cleanup** — Identify intentions to complete, defer, or abandon
- **Focus adjustment** — Recognize patterns in which contexts get less attention

## Notes

- Only considers root-level activity within the intention subtree
- Context filtering uses the root intention's context
- Requires a database backend (PostgreSQL)
