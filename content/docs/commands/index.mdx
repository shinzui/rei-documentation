## FZF Integration

Many commands support interactive selection via [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). When an ID argument is optional and fzf is installed, you'll get an interactive picker.

```bash
# These open fzf if ID is not provided
rei intention show
rei habit show
rei blocker resolve
```

**Interactive Toggle:** In FZF pickers that show intentions, press `ctrl-f` to toggle between viewing only active intentions and viewing all intentions (active + future). This lets you quickly find future intentions without restarting the command.

## Output Formats

Most list commands support format options:

```bash
# Default human-readable output
rei intention list

# FZF-compatible (tab-separated)
rei intention list --format=fzf

# JSON output
rei intention list --format=json
```
