Intentions are the core building blocks of rei. Unlike tasks, intentions represent meaningful commitments to change something in the world.

## What is an Intention?

An intention is not just a task—it's a commitment to a change you want to see happen. Tasks are disposable and interchangeable; intentions have identity and meaning.

**Examples:**
- "Learn to play piano" (not "Practice piano for 30 minutes")
- "Build a personal website" (not "Write HTML files")
- "Become a better writer" (not "Write 500 words")

## Intention Hierarchy

Intentions can have parent-child relationships, allowing you to organize work by meaning:

```
Connect with like-minded people (parent)
└── Become a better writer (child)
    └── Publish first blog post (grandchild)
```

The parent provides context. When you're deep in the details, the parent reminds you *why* it matters.

## Status Lifecycle

Intentions have one of four statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Currently being worked on. Shown in daily dashboard. |
| **Future** | Planned but not yet active. Hidden until activated. |
| **Completed** | Successfully finished. Terminal state. |
| **Abandoned** | No longer pursuing. Terminal state with optional reason. |

### Lifecycle Flow

```
           ┌─────────────────────┐
           │                     │
   create  ▼      defer          │  activate
    ───► Active ◄────────► Future ◄────┘
           │
           │ complete/abandon
           ▼
       Terminal
```

- New intentions start as **Active** by default
- Use `defer` to move to **Future** (also defers children)
- Use `activate` to move back to **Active**
- Use `complete` or `abandon` for terminal states

## Context

Context separates different life domains (e.g., work vs personal):

```bash
rei intention create "Quarterly planning" --context work
rei intention create "Learn Korean" --context personal
```

Filter your view by context:

```bash
rei today --context work
```

<Callout type="info">
Context can only be set on root intentions. Children inherit context from their root ancestor.
</Callout>

## Horizon

Horizon provides a time frame estimate:

```bash
rei intention create "Learn Haskell" --horizon 3m
rei intention create "Fix bug" --horizon 1d
```

Common horizons:
- `1d` — one day
- `1w` — one week
- `1m` — one month
- `1y` — one year
- Custom text like `"Q1 2024"`

## Related Concepts

Intentions connect to other primitives:

- **Actions** — record work done toward an intention
- **Outcomes** — record evidence of progress
- **Blockers** — track what's preventing progress
- **Dependencies** — mark intentions that depend on others
- **Habits** — link recurring practices to intentions
