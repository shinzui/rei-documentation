Habits in rei represent recurring activities with lifecycle management. Unlike one-time tasks, habits are about building consistent practice over time — or breaking unwanted behaviors.

## What is a Habit?

A habit is a recurring activity you commit to. It has:

- **Name** — What you call this habit
- **Purpose** — Why you're doing it
- **Action Template** — Default description when recording actions
- **Schedule** — How often (daily, weekly, monthly, cue-based, etc.)
- **Polarity** — Whether you're building a practice or breaking a behavior

## Habit Types (Polarity)

Rei supports two types of habits:

### Build Habits (Default)

Practices you want to cultivate and perform regularly:

```bash
rei habit create \
  --name "Morning Writing" \
  --purpose "Build creative fluency" \
  --daily \
  --action "Write freely for 30 minutes"
```

### Break Habits

Behaviors you want to avoid or reduce:

```bash
rei habit create \
  --name "Avoid Late-Night Snacking" \
  --purpose "Improve sleep and health" \
  --daily \
  --break
```

Break habits support **abstinence tracking** — start tracking when you begin avoiding the behavior, and log occurrences if you slip:

```bash
# Start abstinence tracking
rei habit start-abstinence habit_01abc...

# Log if the behavior occurred (resets tracking)
rei habit log-occurrence habit_01abc... --note "Stress triggered this"
```

## Scheduling Options

Habits support flexible scheduling to match your needs:

### Fixed Schedules

```bash
# Every day
rei habit create --name "Meditation" --purpose "Mental clarity" --daily

# Specific day of week
rei habit create --name "Weekly Review" --purpose "Reflect on progress" --weekly sunday

# Multiple days per week
rei habit create --name "Gym" --purpose "Build strength" --weekly-on mon,wed,fri

# Monthly on a specific day
rei habit create --name "Finance Review" --purpose "Track spending" --monthly 1

# Quarterly
rei habit create --name "Goals Review" --purpose "Align direction" --quarterly

# Yearly on a specific date
rei habit create --name "Annual Planning" --purpose "Set yearly intentions" \
  --yearly-month 1 --yearly-day 1

# Every N days
rei habit create --name "Water Plants" --purpose "Keep plants healthy" --every 3
```

### Flexible Schedules

When you want to hit a target but don't care which specific days:

```bash
# At least 4 times per week
rei habit create --name "Exercise" --purpose "Stay active" --free-weekly 4

# At least 8 times per month
rei habit create --name "Call Family" --purpose "Stay connected" --free-monthly 8

# At least 4 times per quarter
rei habit create --name "Deep Clean" --purpose "Maintain home" --free-quarterly 4
```

### Cue-Based Habits

Triggered by context rather than time:

```bash
rei habit create \
  --name "Mindful Breathing" \
  --purpose "Reduce stress" \
  --cue "When feeling stressed" \
  --target "3/week"
```

Cue-based habits appear in the "Cue-Based Habits" section of your daily dashboard, showing when you last performed them.

## Linking to Intentions

Habits become more meaningful when connected to intentions:

```bash
rei habit link-intention habit_01abc... intention_01xyz...
```

This connection:
- Provides context for why you're doing the habit
- Shows habit progress in intention views
- Makes habit actions contribute to the intention
- Inherits context from the intention

```bash
# Record action for a linked habit (automatically associates with intention)
rei habit record-action habit_01abc... "Completed morning session"
```

## Habit Lifecycle

Habits have their own lifecycle:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Active** | Currently tracking this habit |
| **Paused** | Temporarily stopped (e.g., vacation, injury) |
| **Retired** | Permanently ended |

```bash
# Pause a habit
rei habit pause habit_01abc...

# Resume a paused habit
rei habit resume habit_01abc...

# Retire a habit permanently
rei habit retire habit_01abc...
```

### Automatic Pause/Resume with Blockers

When you declare a blocker on a habit, it **automatically pauses**:

```bash
rei blocker declare --habit habit_01abc... "Gym closed for renovation"
```

When the last blocker is resolved, the habit **automatically resumes**:

```bash
rei blocker resolve --habit habit_01abc... blocker_01xyz...
```

This saves you from manually managing habit status during obstacles.

## Tracking Adherence

### Daily Status

```bash
rei habit status
```

Shows all habits with their adherence rates and completion status.

### Visual Tracker

See your adherence over time with a visual calendar:

```bash
# Last 30 days (default)
rei habit tracker habit_01abc...

# Last 60 days
rei habit tracker habit_01abc... --days 60
```

The tracker shows a calendar grid highlighting completed days, making it easy to visualize streaks and patterns.

### Recording Actions

Record when you complete a habit:

```bash
# Basic recording
rei habit record-action habit_01abc... "Morning session completed"

# With timing
rei habit record-action habit_01abc... --at "2 hours ago"

# With duration
rei habit record-action habit_01abc... --duration 30m

# Use the habit's action template
rei habit record-action habit_01abc...
```

## Context and Organization

### Setting Context

Unlinked habits can have their own context:

```bash
rei habit set-context habit_01abc... personal
rei habit clear-context habit_01abc...
```

Linked habits automatically inherit context from their intention.

### Filtering by Context

```bash
rei habit list --context work
```

## Reminders

Set reminders to nudge yourself about habits:

```bash
rei habit remind habit_01abc... "Time for weekly review" --at "sunday 9am"
```

## Habits vs Intentions

| Habits | Intentions |
|--------|------------|
| Recurring activities | Commitments with outcomes |
| Focus on practice | Focus on results |
| "I write daily" | "I published a book" |
| Process-oriented | Goal-oriented |
| Build or Break | Always building toward something |

Both work together: habits build the practice that enables intentions to be achieved.

## Quick Reference

# Create habits
rei habit create --name "..." --purpose "..." --daily
rei habit create --name "..." --purpose "..." --break  # Break habit

# Manage lifecycle
rei habit pause/resume/retire habit_01abc...

# Track progress
rei habit status
rei habit tracker habit_01abc...

# Record completions
rei habit record-action habit_01abc... "Description"

# Link to intentions

# Break habit tracking
rei habit start-abstinence habit_01abc...
rei habit log-occurrence habit_01abc...
```
