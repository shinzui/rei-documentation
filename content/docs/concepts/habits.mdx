Habits in rei represent recurring activities with lifecycle management. Unlike one-time tasks, habits are about building consistent practice over time.

## What is a Habit?

A habit is a recurring activity you commit to. It has:

- **Name** — What you call this habit
- **Purpose** — Why you're doing it
- **Action** — What you actually do each time
- **Schedule** — How often (daily, weekly, specific days)

## Creating Habits

```bash
# Daily habit
rei habit create \
  --name "Morning Pages" \
  --purpose "Build writing fluency" \
  --daily \
  --action "Write 3 pages"

# Weekly habit
rei habit create \
  --name "Weekly Review" \
  --purpose "Reflect on progress" \
  --weekly \
  --action "Review intentions and plan next week"

# Specific days
rei habit create \
  --name "Exercise" \
  --purpose "Stay healthy" \
  --weekdays Mon,Wed,Fri \
  --action "30 minutes workout"
```

## Linking to Intentions

Habits become more meaningful when connected to intentions:

```bash
rei habit link-intention <habit-id> <intention-id>
```

This connection:
- Provides context for why you're doing the habit
- Shows habit progress in intention views
- Helps during reflection

## Habit Lifecycle

Habits have their own lifecycle:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Active** | Currently tracking this habit |
| **Paused** | Temporarily stopped (e.g., vacation) |
| **Retired** | Permanently ended |

```bash
# Pause a habit
rei habit pause <id>

# Resume a paused habit
rei habit resume <id>

# Retire a habit permanently
rei habit retire <id>
```

## Tracking Adherence

View your habit status:

```bash
# See today's habits
rei habit status

# See habit details with adherence
rei habit show <id>
```

The status shows:
- Which habits are due today
- Your adherence percentage
- Current streak

## Habits vs Intentions

| Habits | Intentions |
|--------|------------|
| Recurring activities | One-time commitments |
| Focus on practice | Focus on outcomes |
| "I write daily" | "I published a book" |
| Process-oriented | Goal-oriented |

Both work together: habits build the practice that enables intentions to be achieved.
