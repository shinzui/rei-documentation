Focus areas and cycles help you allocate time intentionally across different types of work.

## What is a Focus?

A focus is a category of activity you want to track. Examples:

- **Create** — Making new things
- **Study** — Learning and research
- **Connect** — Relationship building
- **Play** — Recreation and rest
- **Read** — Books and articles

## The Anatomy of Equanimity Template

Rei includes a pre-built template based on "The Anatomy of Equanimity":

```bash
rei focus import anatomy-of-equanimity
```

This creates five focus areas:
- **Connect** — Relationships and community
- **Read** — Books, articles, learning materials
- **Study** — Deeper learning and practice
- **Play** — Recreation, games, rest
- **Create** — Making things, writing, building

## Managing Focus Areas

```bash
# Create a custom focus area
rei focus create --name "Exercise" --description "Physical activity"

# List all focus areas
rei focus list

# Show focus area details
rei focus show <id>

# Retire a focus area
rei focus retire <id>
```

## What is a Cycle?

A cycle is a bounded time period for tracking which focus areas you engaged with each day. You define the cycle length (e.g., 7 days, 10 days) and select one focus per day.

```bash
# Start a 10-day cycle
rei cycle start --length 10

# Start a named 7-day cycle
rei cycle start --length 7 --name "Week 1"

# See current cycle status
rei cycle status
```

## Recording Focus

Each day during a cycle, record which focus area you're engaging with:

```bash
# Select a focus for today (interactive)
rei cycle select-focus

# Select a specific focus
rei cycle select-focus <focus-id>

# Update a past day's focus
rei cycle select-focus <focus-id> --date 2025-01-05
```

At the end of the cycle:

```bash
# Complete the cycle
rei cycle complete

# Or abandon if you want to start fresh
rei cycle abandon
```

## Why Track Focus?

Tracking focus helps you:

1. **See patterns** — Where does your time actually go?
2. **Balance** — Are you neglecting important areas?
3. **Adjust** — Make intentional changes based on data
4. **Reflect** — "I haven't Created in a week" prompts action

## Focus vs Intentions

| Focus | Intentions |
|-------|------------|
| Categories of activity | Specific commitments |
| Recurring/ongoing | Have completion |
| "What type of work" | "What am I trying to achieve" |

Both work together. An intention like "Write a book" involves focus areas like Create, Study, and Read.
