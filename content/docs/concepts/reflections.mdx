Reflections are deliberate interpretations of past work. Unlike actions (which record what you did), reflections capture what you *learned* and what it *means*.

## Why Reflect?

Memory is unreliable. What felt important yesterday fades. Reflection:

- Captures insights while they're fresh
- Builds self-awareness over time
- Creates a record you can reference later
- Transforms raw experience into wisdom

## Types of Reflections

### Daily Reflection

Reflect on today's work:

```bash
rei reflect today
```

This opens your editor to capture:
- What you accomplished
- What surprised you
- What you learned
- What you'll do differently

### Weekly Reflection

Reflect on the past week:

```bash
rei reflect week
```

Weekly reflection is broader:
- Patterns you noticed
- Progress toward intentions
- What worked and what didn't
- Adjustments for next week

### Intention Reflection

Reflect on a specific intention:

```bash
rei reflect intention <id>
```

Useful when:
- Completing an intention
- Hitting a milestone
- Feeling stuck
- Making a decision

## Reflection Workflow

1. **Open** — Create a new reflection
2. **Write** — Capture your thoughts in your editor
3. **Complete** — Mark the reflection as done
4. **Review** — Reference past reflections when needed

```bash
# See pending reflections
rei reflect pending

# See reflection history
rei reflect history
```

## AI-Assisted Reflection

Let the AI agent help prompt your thinking:

```bash
rei agent reflect today
rei agent reflect week
```

The agent reviews your recent activity and asks questions to help you reflect more deeply.

## Building the Habit

Reflection works best as a regular practice:

- **Daily** — 5 minutes at end of day
- **Weekly** — 15-30 minutes on Sunday
- **Milestone** — whenever you complete something significant

The insights compound over time. After a month, you'll have a valuable record of your growth.
