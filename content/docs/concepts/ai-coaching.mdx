Rei includes AI coaching features that help you gain perspective on your work without taking control away from you.

## Philosophy

AI agents in rei:

- **Read your data** — They see your intentions, actions, reflections
- **Offer perspective** — They ask questions and suggest approaches
- **Never mutate state** — Only you can change your data
- **Nudge, don't nag** — Helpful prompts, not guilt trips

## Agent Commands

### Coaching

Get general coaching based on your current state:

```bash
rei agent coach
```

Focus on today's context:

```bash
rei agent coach --today
```

### Nudges

Get a quick suggestion for what to do next:

```bash
rei agent nudge
```

### Review

Deep dive on a specific intention:

```bash
rei agent review <intention-id>
```

### Reflection Help

AI-assisted reflection prompts:

```bash
rei agent reflect today
rei agent reflect week
```

## Intention-Level Guidance

You can attach custom guidance to specific intentions:

```bash
rei intention guidance <id> "Remind me to focus on quality over quantity"
```

This guidance is included when the agent reviews that intention.

## Configuration

### LLM Backend

Rei supports two backends:

**claude-cli** (default) — Uses the Claude CLI if installed:

```bash
export REI_LLM_BACKEND=claude-cli
```

**anthropic-api** — Direct API access:

```bash
export REI_LLM_BACKEND=anthropic-api
export REI_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Model Override

Override the default model:

```bash
export REI_LLM_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229
```

## When to Use AI Coaching

Good times:
- Feeling stuck on an intention
- End of day/week reflection
- Making a decision about priorities
- Need fresh perspective

Not a replacement for:
- Doing the work
- Making your own decisions
- Your own judgment and values

The agent is a thinking partner, not an oracle.
