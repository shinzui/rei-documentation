Rei is built around **intentional action over time**. Unlike task managers that focus on what you do, rei focuses on *why* you do it and *what changes* as a result.

## The Nine Primitives

Everything in rei is built from nine composable primitives:

### Work Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Intention** | A commitment to a meaningful change in the world |
| **Action** | The concrete work you perform |
| **Outcome** | Observable evidence that something changed |
| **Blocker** | What prevents the next meaningful action |
| **Dependency** | Another intention that constrains this one |

### Practice Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Habit** | A recurring activity with lifecycle management |
| **Reflection** | Deliberate interpretation of past work |

### Time Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Focus** | A category of activity for daily time allocation |
| **Cycle** | A bounded time period for tracking focus selections |

## Key Principles

### 1. Event-Sourced Truth

State is derived, never mutated directly. Every change is recorded as an immutable event. This means:

- Complete history of everything that happened
- No data loss from updates or deletes
- Ability to rebuild views from events

### 2. Intention-Centered

Organize work by meaning, not checklists. An intention is not a task—it's a commitment to change something in the world. Tasks are disposable; intentions have identity.

### 3. Evidence-Based Review

Outcomes and reflections beat memory. Instead of checking boxes, you record evidence of progress and reflect on what it means.

### 4. Local-First & Transparent

Files are yours; nothing is hidden. Your workspace is a folder of markdown files. The database stores events, but knowledge lives in files you control.

### 5. Agent Coaching Without Magic

AI agents nudge based on facts, not magic. They read your data and offer perspective, but they never change your state. You remain in control.
