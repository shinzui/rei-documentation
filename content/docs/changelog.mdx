### New Command: Reminders

Create and manage time-based reminders with the new `rei reminder` command:

- `rei reminder create` — Create reminders for intentions, habits, actions, or notes
- `rei reminder list` — List reminders with filtering (triggered, pending, by entity)
- `rei reminder complete` — Mark a reminder as completed
- `rei reminder snooze` — Snooze triggered reminders to a later time
- `rei reminder cancel` — Cancel a reminder
- `rei reminder reschedule` — Reschedule a pending reminder
- `rei reminder check` — Quick view of triggered reminders

Reminders support flexible time formats including relative expressions (`2 hours`, `tomorrow`) and ISO 8601 timestamps.

### Reminder Shortcuts

Create reminders directly from entity commands:

- `rei intention remind` — Create reminder for an intention
- `rei habit remind` — Create reminder for a habit
- `rei note remind` — Create reminder for a note

### Habit Enhancements

- **`rei habit tracker`** — Visual adherence tracker showing a calendar grid of completed days
  - Customize with `--days` option (default: 30 days)
  - Great for visualizing streaks and patterns

### Note Enhancements

- **`rei note get-help`** — Get AI-assisted help with a note via Claude Code

### Outcome Enhancements

- **`rei outcome record`** — Enhanced with FZF support, stdin input, and `--at` option
  - Record outcomes at specific times with relative or ISO 8601 timestamps

### Dashboard Integration

### New Command: Support Relationships

Manage support relationships between intentions with the new `rei support` command:

- `rei support add` — Declare that one intention supports another
- `rei support show` — View what an intention supports
- `rei support supported-by` — View what supports an intention
- `rei support remove` — Remove a support relationship

Support relationships are informational (unlike dependencies which block progress), helping you understand how intentions relate. For example: "Learn Haskell" **supports** "Build personal website".

### Action Enhancements

- **ISO 8601 timestamps** — The `--at` option now accepts absolute timestamps in addition to relative times:
  - UTC: `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z`
  - With timezone: `2024-01-15T14:30:00+09:00`
  - Local time: `2024-01-15T14:30:00`

### Intention Enhancements

- **`rei intention tree`** — New filtering options:
  - `--future` — Show future intentions with parent chains
  - `--all` — Show both active and future intentions
  - `--completed` — Show completed intentions with parent chains
- **`rei intention show --full`** — Now displays "Supports" and "Supported By" sections

### FZF Enhancements

- **Interactive Toggle** — Press `ctrl-f` in FZF pickers to toggle between active-only and all intentions (active + future)

Find intentions that haven't had any activity in a specified number of days:

- `rei neglected` — Find intentions with no activity in 10+ days (default)

- `rei neglected --context work` — Filter by context

Output shows color-coded severity based on inactivity duration.

### Action Enhancements

- **`rei action update-occurred-at`** — Correct when an action occurred after recording
  - Supports relative time expressions (`2 hours ago`, `yesterday`, `-2h`)
  - FZF integration for selecting action and intention

### Habit Enhancements

- **`rei habit record-action --duration`** — Track how long habit actions took
  - Supports all duration formats (`30m`, `1h30m`, `1.5h`, etc.)
- **`rei habit update-action-occurred-at`** — Correct timestamps for habit actions
  - FZF integration for selecting habit then action

### Dashboard Enhancements
