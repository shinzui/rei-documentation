## 2026-01-13

### New Command: Workspace Management

Git integration for automatic versioning of workspace files:

- `rei workspace git-check` — Check if workspace is a git repository
- `rei workspace git-status` — Show git status of workspace files

### New Command: Subscription Workers

Run subscription workers that maintain read models from the event stream:

- `rei subscription run all` — Run all subscription workers
- `rei subscription run <worker>` — Run a specific worker

New `git-commit` worker automatically commits workspace files with meaningful messages:
- Notes, reflections, documents, and guidance files
- Commit messages include entity metadata (title, anchor type, tags)

### Note Enhancements

- **`rei note get-help`** — Help notes now automatically include a wikilink back to the original note, creating navigable relationships

---

## 2026-01-12

### New Feature: Wikilinks Between Notes

Link notes together using familiar wiki-style syntax:

- `[[Note Title]]` — Link to a note by its title
- `[[Note Title|custom text]]` — Link with custom display text

Wikilinks are automatically resolved when matching note titles exist. New commands help you navigate and maintain your note network:

- `rei note backlinks` — See which notes link to a specific note
- `rei note broken-links` — Find references to notes that don't exist yet

### Reminder Enhancements

- **`rei reminder check`** — Now automatically triggers due reminders, not just displays them. This ensures reminders transition from "pending" to "triggered" status when their scheduled time arrives.

---

### New Feature: Daily Notes

Capture daily thoughts and tasks with the new `rei note today` command:

- `rei note today` — Open or create today's daily note
- `rei note today --date 2026-01-10` — Work with notes for specific dates
- `rei note today -t journal` — Create notes with tags

Daily notes are anchored to **JournalEntry** entities, giving each day its own identity. Tasks added to daily notes automatically receive a due date matching that day — perfect for daily task lists.

### New Feature: Overview Notes for Intentions

Designate a note as the overview for an intention to provide context and serve as an entry point:

- `rei intention set-overview` — Designate a note as the overview for an intention
- `rei intention clear-overview` — Remove the overview designation

Overview notes appear prominently in `rei intention show --full` output, making it easy to capture and surface important context about your intentions.

## 2026-01-11

### New Command: System Administration

Added `rei system` for administrative maintenance tasks:

- `rei system evaluate-dormancy` — Mark inactive intentions as dormant based on configurable threshold
- `rei system fix-dormancy` — Fix incorrectly dormant intentions using hierarchy-aware evaluation

Dormancy is now hierarchy-aware: parent intentions with active children won't be marked dormant. Configure the inactivity threshold in your config file with `intention.dormancyThresholdDays`.

### Intention Enhancements

- **`rei intention show --full`** — Now displays Tasks, Linked habits, and Reminders sections

---

## 2026-01-10

### New Command: Reminders

Create and manage time-based reminders with the new `rei reminder` command:

- `rei reminder snooze` — Snooze triggered reminders to a later time
- `rei reminder cancel` — Cancel a reminder
- `rei reminder reschedule` — Reschedule a pending reminder
- `rei reminder check` — Quick view of triggered reminders

Reminders support flexible time formats including relative expressions (`2 hours`, `tomorrow`) and ISO 8601 timestamps.

### Reminder Shortcuts

Create reminders directly from entity commands:

- `rei intention remind` — Create reminder for an intention
- `rei habit remind` — Create reminder for a habit
- `rei note remind` — Create reminder for a note

### Habit Enhancements

- `rei support add` — Declare that one intention supports another
- `rei support show` — View what an intention supports
- `rei support supported-by` — View what supports an intention
- `rei support remove` — Remove a support relationship

Support relationships are informational (unlike dependencies which block progress), helping you understand how intentions relate. For example: "Learn Haskell" **supports** "Build personal website".

### Action Enhancements

- **ISO 8601 timestamps** — The `--at` option now accepts absolute timestamps in addition to relative times:

- `rei neglected --context work` — Filter by context

Output shows color-coded severity based on inactivity duration.

  - FZF integration for selecting habit then action

### Dashboard Enhancements
