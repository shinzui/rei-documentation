## 2026-01-20

### New Feature: Cycle Reflections

Reflect on completed cycles to capture learnings and insights:

- `rei reflect cycle` — Start a reflection for the last completed cycle
- `rei reflect cycle cycle_01abc...` — Reflect on a specific cycle
- `rei reflect cycle --prompt "What did you learn?"` — With a custom prompt

The reflection includes context from the completed cycle — focus selections, duration, and progress.

### New Feature: Cycle Backdating

Forgot to start or complete a cycle on time? Backdate it:

- `rei cycle start --length 10 --at yesterday` — Backdate cycle start
- `rei cycle complete --at yesterday` — Backdate cycle completion

### Enhancements

- **`rei action record`** — FZF now offers optional habit selection after choosing an intention (with "Skip" option). Use `--no-habit` to skip entirely.
- **`rei category print-note-guidance`** — Print category guidance to stdout for review or piping
- **`rei category improve-note-guidance`** — Improve category guidance with AI assistance
- **`rei category show`** — Now displays note guidance path when configured
- **`rei note get-help --append`** — Append AI help directly to the original note instead of creating a separate note
- **`rei note list --json`** — Output notes as JSON for scripting

### New Command: Help Topics

Display detailed help on specific Rei concepts and features:

- `rei help` — List all available help topics
- `rei help time` — Learn about time formats and the `--at` flag

For command-specific help, continue using `rei <command> --help`.

### New Feature: Agent Debug Mode

All agent commands now support `--debug` to see the rendered prompt without invoking the LLM:

```bash
rei agent --debug coach
rei agent --debug review intention_01abc...
rei agent --debug reflect today
```

This is useful for testing prompt construction and debugging context loading.

### New Feature: Category Note Guidance

Categories can now have note guidance that automatically applies when using `rei note get-help` on notes in that category:

- `rei category set-note-guidance learning/japanese -c "Focus on stroke order"` — Set guidance
- `rei category clear-note-guidance learning/japanese` — Remove guidance

Category guidance provides domain knowledge (e.g., "how to study kanji") that composes with intention-level guidance when both are present.

### New Feature: Dormancy Reminders

When an intention becomes dormant (inactive for 30+ days), Rei now automatically creates a reminder to prompt you to revisit it. Dormancy reminders are:
- Scheduled 21 days after the intention becomes dormant
- Automatically cancelled when the intention awakens
- Automatically completed when the intention reaches a terminal state

View system reminders with `rei reminder list --system`.

### Enhancements

- **`rei action update-duration`** — Correct the duration of an existing action
- **`rei note get-help --include-doc`** — Include attached documents in the AI context
- **`rei note get-help -i`** — Start an interactive Claude Code session for back-and-forth conversation
- **`rei note get-help --debug`** — See the prompt that would be sent to the LLM
- **`rei reminder list --system`** — Filter to show only system-generated reminders
- **`rei today --include-dormant`** — Include dormant intentions in the dashboard (excluded by default)

### New Command: Daily Dashboard

See everything that needs attention today in one place:

- `rei today` — Display your daily dashboard with all active work
- `rei today --context work` — Filter to a specific context
- `rei today --tui` — Launch interactive TUI mode

The dashboard shows:
- Active cycle and today's focus area
- Triggered reminders
- Active intentions (grouped by context)
- Intentions completed today
- Tasks (overdue, due today, upcoming)
- Today's actions with times and durations
- Active blockers
- Scheduled and cue-based habits
- Pending reflections

### New Command: Weekly Review

Analyze your progress over the current week:

- `rei review week` — Show weekly review summary (Monday-Sunday)
- `rei review week --context work` — Filter by context

The review displays:
- Intention statistics (active, completed this week)
- Action breakdown by intention
- Outcomes recorded
- Habit adherence with color-coded percentages
- Blocker count
- Reflection activity (completed vs skipped)

### Enhancements

- **`rei note show`** — View comprehensive note details including embedded files, attached documents, tags, and category without opening the editor

---

## 2026-01-17

### New Command: Document Attachments

Attach files to entities for reference and context:

- `rei doc attach` — Attach files to intentions, actions, outcomes, reflections, or notes

- `rei knowledge verify --embeds` — Also verify embedded files (`![[file.pdf]]`) in notes

### New Feature: Note Guidance for Intentions

Set AI guidance that automatically applies when getting help with any note under an intention:

- `rei intention set-note-guidance` — Set guidance via editor, inline, or stdin
- `rei intention show-note-guidance` — View current guidance
- `rei intention clear-note-guidance` — Remove guidance

When you have multiple notes under an intention that need similar help context, set note guidance once on the intention rather than repeating `--focus` on every `note get-help` call.

### New Feature: File Embeds in Notes

Notes now support Obsidian-style file embedding:

```markdown
See the diagram: ![[architecture.png]]
Reference: ![[research-paper.pdf]]
```

- `rei note embeds` — Show embedded files discovered in a note

### New Command: Categories

Categories provide a flexible way to classify and organize your actions, notes, and intentions. Unlike contexts (which group root intentions by life domain), categories form a hierarchical tree that can be applied to any entity.

**Core commands:**

- `rei category create` — Create a new category with optional parent and description
- `rei category list` — List categories (hierarchical by default, or flat)
- `rei category tree` — View category hierarchy as a tree
- `rei category show` — Show details of a specific category
- `rei category retire` — Soft-delete a category (preserved for historical data)
- `rei category reactivate` — Bring back a retired category
- `rei category link-focus` — Link a category to a focus area for time tracking

**Hierarchical slugs:**

Categories support parent-child relationships. The slug is automatically computed:

```bash
rei category create "Work" -d "Work activities"        # slug: work
rei category create "Meeting" -p work                   # slug: work/meeting
rei category create "1-on-1" -p work/meeting           # slug: work/meeting/1-on-1
```

**Category assignment:**

Assign categories to entities for classification:

- `rei action set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize actions
- `rei note set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize notes
- `rei intention set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize intentions

Categories can be linked to focus areas to enable category-based time tracking and reporting.

### New Feature: Agent Interactive Mode

All `rei agent` commands now support interactive mode with the `-i/--interactive` flag:

- `rei agent coach -i` — Start an interactive coaching session
- `rei agent review -i` — Interactive deep-dive into an intention
- `rei agent nudge -i` — Interactive nudge session
- `rei agent reflect today -i` — Interactive reflection help

Interactive mode starts Claude Code with your Rei state pre-loaded. Claude can record actions, resolve blockers, and make changes on your behalf — all `rei` commands are pre-approved, so you won't see permission prompts.

### New Feature: Habit Polarity (Build vs Break)

Habits now support two polarities:

- **Build habits** (default) — Practices you want to cultivate and perform regularly
- **Break habits** — Behaviors you want to avoid or reduce

Create Break habits with the `--break` flag:

```bash
rei habit create \
  --name "Avoid Late-Night Snacking" \
  --purpose "Improve sleep and health" \
  --daily \
  --break
```

Break habits support abstinence tracking:

- `rei habit start-abstinence` — Start tracking how long you've avoided the behavior
- `rei habit log-occurrence` — Log when the behavior occurred (resets tracking)

### New Feature: Expanded Habit Cadences

Habits now support many more scheduling options beyond daily and weekly:

**Fixed schedules:**
- `--monthly <day>` — Monthly on a specific day (1-31)
- `--quarterly` — Quarterly habit
- `--yearly-month <month> --yearly-day <day>` — Yearly on a specific date
- `--every <n>` — Every N days (e.g., every 3 days)

**Flexible schedules:**
- `--free-weekly <count>` — At least N times per week
- `--free-monthly <count>` — At least N times per month
- `--free-quarterly <count>` — At least N times per quarter
- `--free-yearly <count>` — At least N times per year

**Cue-based:**
- `--cue <description>` — Triggered by a specific context (e.g., "After meals")
- `--target <frequency>` — Optional frequency goal (e.g., "3/week")

### Action Enhancements

- **`rei action reassociate`** — Move an action from one intention to another. Useful when you accidentally recorded an action against the wrong intention. Historical data is preserved.

### Cycle Enhancements

- **`rei cycle extend <days>`** — Extend an active cycle by additional days. Only works on active cycles (not completed or abandoned).

- `rei intention tracker --style heatmap` — Use GitHub-style heatmap visualization
- `rei intention tracker --days 180` — Customize the time range
- `rei intention tracker --include-children` — Include actions from child intentions

Two display styles are available: **calendar** (default) shows a week-by-week grid with intensity markers, while **heatmap** shows a GitHub-style contribution graph.

### Configuration: Git Auto-Commit Options

- `rei workspace git-check` — Check if workspace is a git repository
- `rei workspace git-status` — Show git status of workspace files

### New Command: Subscription Workers

Run subscription workers that maintain read models from the event stream:

- `rei subscription run all` — Run all subscription workers
- `rei subscription run <worker>` — Run a specific worker

New `git-commit` worker automatically commits workspace files with meaningful messages:
- Notes, reflections, documents, and guidance files
- Commit messages include entity metadata (title, anchor type, tags)

### Note Enhancements

- **`rei note get-help`** — Help notes now automatically include a wikilink back to the original note, creating navigable relationships

---

## 2026-01-12

### New Feature: Wikilinks Between Notes

Link notes together using familiar wiki-style syntax:

- `[[Note Title]]` — Link to a note by its title
- `[[Note Title|custom text]]` — Link with custom display text

Wikilinks are automatically resolved when matching note titles exist. New commands help you navigate and maintain your note network:

- `rei note backlinks` — See which notes link to a specific note
- `rei note broken-links` — Find references to notes that don't exist yet

### Reminder Enhancements

- **`rei reminder check`** — Now automatically triggers due reminders, not just displays them. This ensures reminders transition from "pending" to "triggered" status when their scheduled time arrives.

---

### New Feature: Daily Notes

Capture daily thoughts and tasks with the new `rei note today` command:

- `rei note today` — Open or create today's daily note
- `rei note today --date 2026-01-10` — Work with notes for specific dates
- `rei note today -t journal` — Create notes with tags

Daily notes are anchored to **JournalEntry** entities, giving each day its own identity. Tasks added to daily notes automatically receive a due date matching that day — perfect for daily task lists.

### New Feature: Overview Notes for Intentions

Designate a note as the overview for an intention to provide context and serve as an entry point:

- `rei intention set-overview` — Designate a note as the overview for an intention
- `rei intention clear-overview` — Remove the overview designation

Overview notes appear prominently in `rei intention show --full` output, making it easy to capture and surface important context about your intentions.

### New Command: System Administration

Added `rei system` for administrative maintenance tasks:

- `rei system evaluate-dormancy` — Mark inactive intentions as dormant based on configurable threshold
- `rei system fix-dormancy` — Fix incorrectly dormant intentions using hierarchy-aware evaluation

Dormancy is now hierarchy-aware: parent intentions with active children won't be marked dormant. Configure the inactivity threshold in your config file with `intention.dormancyThresholdDays`.

### Intention Enhancements

- **`rei intention show --full`** — Now displays Tasks, Linked habits, and Reminders sections

- `rei support add` — Declare that one intention supports another
- `rei support show` — View what an intention supports
- `rei support supported-by` — View what supports an intention
- `rei support remove` — Remove a support relationship

Support relationships are informational (unlike dependencies which block progress), helping you understand how intentions relate. For example: "Learn Haskell" **supports** "Build personal website".

### Action Enhancements
