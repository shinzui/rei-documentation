## 2026-02-01

### New Feature: Tree TUI Fuzzy Filtering

Press `/` in `rei intention tree --tui` to enter filter mode:

- Type any characters to fuzzy-match against intention titles
- Non-contiguous matches work (e.g., "abc" matches "Add blocker component")
- Matched characters highlighted in yellow
- Match count shows as `(3/15)` in the filter bar
- Navigate with `j`/`k` while filtering
- Press `Esc` to clear filter

### New Feature: Property Existence Filter

Filter intentions by whether they have a property set:

```bash
rei intention list --where "priority:exists"
rei intention list --where "workflow:exists"
```

### Custom Property Enhancements

- **`rei custom-property relabel`** — Renamed from `rename` for clarity
- **`rei custom-property add-state --order`** — Set display order when adding states
- **`rei custom-property update-state-order`** — Update display order for existing states
- **`rei custom-property init-entities`** — Retroactively initialize state machine properties for entities with matching categories

### Automatic State Machine Initialization

State machine properties scoped to a category are now automatically initialized when a category is assigned to an entity. Use `init-entities` to retroactively initialize existing entities.

---

### New Feature: Intention Grouping

Group intention list output by custom property values:

```bash
rei intention list --group-by priority
rei intention list --group-by workflow
rei intention list --context work --group-by priority
rei intention list --where "effort>=3" --group-by priority
```

Intentions are organized into groups by their property value, with counts shown for each group. Group sorting order:

- **State machine properties**: sorted by `stateOrder` (ascending), then alphabetically
- **Numeric properties**: sorted descending (highest values first)
- **Text/enum properties**: sorted alphabetically ascending
- **"(none)" group**: always last (intentions without the property)

Grouping only works with `--format default` and can be combined with all other filters.

### New Guide: Custom Properties

Added comprehensive **[Custom Properties Guide](/docs/guides/custom-properties)** covering property types, state machines, filtering, and best practices.

### New Guide: Time Formats

Added **[Time Formats Guide](/docs/guides/time-formats)** documenting relative and absolute time formats for the `--at` flag.

## 2026-02-01 (Earlier)

### New Command: Yesterday Dashboard

Quick review of the previous day's activity:

- `rei yesterday` — Review yesterday's activity and accomplishments
- `rei yesterday --context work` — Filter to a specific context

The yesterday dashboard shows:
- Cycle context (if yesterday was part of an active cycle)
- Completed intentions
- Actions taken with timestamps, durations, and notes
- Outcomes recorded
- Habits scheduled with completion status
- Reflections performed

### New Command: Review Day

Review any arbitrary date with the new `day` subcommand:

- `rei review day` — Review yesterday (same data as `rei yesterday`)
- `rei review day 2025-01-15` — Review a specific date
- `rei review day --date 2025-01-15 -c work` — Combine date and context filter

Use `rei yesterday` for quick access to the previous day, or `rei review day [DATE]` when you need to review a specific date.

### New Commands: Intention Detach and Note List

Manage intention hierarchy and notes:

- `rei intention detach` — Detach an intention from its parent, making it a root intention
- `rei intention note list` — List notes attached to an intention (including notes on actions, outcomes, and reflections)
- `rei intention note list --recursive` — Include notes from all descendant intentions

---

## 2026-01-31

### New Feature: State Tag Filtering

Filter intentions across all state machine properties by system tag:

```bash
rei intention list --state-tag queue      # Items waiting to be worked on
rei intention list --state-tag active     # Items currently in progress
rei intention list --state-tag done       # Completed items
rei intention list --state-tag terminal   # Items in final states
```

This is useful for cross-property queries when you have multiple state machine properties (like `task-status` or `review-status`) and want to find all items in a particular state category without knowing which specific property or state value to query.

### New Feature: Category Filter for Intentions

Filter intentions by category slug:

```bash
rei intention list --category projects
rei intention list --category projects --future
rei intention list --category personal/health
```

### New Help Topic: Intention Filtering

**State machine properties** support workflows with defined states and transitions:
- Configure via YAML file with `--type-state-machine --from-file workflow.yaml`
- Evolve state machines with `add-state`, `remove-state`, `add-transition`, `remove-transition`
- Use system tags (TagQueue, TagActive, TagDone, TagTerminal) for semantic meaning

### Using Properties on Entities

Assign property values to entities:

- `rei intention set-property priority high` — Set property on an intention
- `rei habit set-property effort 5` — Set property on a habit
- `rei disruption set-property severity critical` — Set property on a disruption
- `rei intention clear-property priority` — Remove a property value

### Filtering by Properties

Filter entity lists using the new `--where` flag:

- `rei intention list --where priority=high` — Filter by exact match
- `rei intention list --where "effort>=5"` — Filter by numeric comparison
- `rei habit list --where "effort<3"` — Works on habits too
- `rei disruption list --where severity=critical` — And disruptions

### New Commands: Habit Categories

Habits can now be categorized:

```bash
rei category create "Work" -d "Work activities"        # slug: work
rei category create "Meeting" -p work                   # slug: work/meeting
rei category create "1-on-1" -p work/meeting           # slug: work/meeting/1-on-1
```

**Category assignment:**

Assign categories to entities for classification:

- `rei action set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize actions
- `rei note set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize notes
- `rei intention set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize intentions

Categories can be linked to focus areas to enable category-based time tracking and reporting.

### New Feature: Habit Polarity (Build vs Break)

Habits now support two polarities:

- **Build habits** (default) — Practices you want to cultivate and perform regularly
- **Break habits** — Behaviors you want to avoid or reduce

Create Break habits with the `--break` flag:

- Notes, reflections, documents, and guidance files
- Commit messages include entity metadata (title, anchor type, tags)

### Note Enhancements

- **`rei note get-help`** — Help notes now automatically include a wikilink back to the original note, creating navigable relationships

---

## 2026-01-12

### New Feature: Wikilinks Between Notes

Link notes together using familiar wiki-style syntax:

- `[[Note Title|custom text]]` — Link with custom display text

Wikilinks are automatically resolved when matching note titles exist. New commands help you navigate and maintain your note network:

- `rei note backlinks` — See which notes link to a specific note
- `rei note broken-links` — Find references to notes that don't exist yet

### Reminder Enhancements

- **`rei reminder check`** — Now automatically triggers due reminders, not just displays them. This ensures reminders transition from "pending" to "triggered" status when their scheduled time arrives.

Daily notes are anchored to **JournalEntry** entities, giving each day its own identity. Tasks added to daily notes automatically receive a due date matching that day — perfect for daily task lists.

### New Feature: Overview Notes for Intentions

Designate a note as the overview for an intention to provide context and serve as an entry point:

- `rei intention set-overview` — Designate a note as the overview for an intention
- `rei intention clear-overview` — Remove the overview designation

Overview notes appear prominently in `rei intention show --full` output, making it easy to capture and surface important context about your intentions.

---

## 2026-01-11

### New Command: System Administration

Added `rei system` for administrative maintenance tasks:

- `rei system evaluate-dormancy` — Mark inactive intentions as dormant based on configurable threshold

Dormancy is hierarchy-aware: parent intentions with active children won't be marked dormant. Configure the inactivity threshold in your config file with `intention.dormancyThresholdDays`.

### Intention Enhancements

- **`rei intention show --full`** — Now displays Tasks, Linked habits, and Reminders sections

### New Command: Support Relationships

Manage support relationships between intentions with the new `rei support` command:

- `rei support add` — Declare that one intention supports another
- `rei support show` — View what an intention supports
- `rei support supported-by` — View what supports an intention
- `rei support remove` — Remove a support relationship

Support relationships are informational (unlike dependencies which block progress), helping you understand how intentions relate. For example: "Learn Haskell" **supports** "Build personal website".

### Action Enhancements

- **ISO 8601 timestamps** — The `--at` option now accepts absolute timestamps in addition to relative times:
  - UTC: `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z`
  - With timezone: `2024-01-15T14:30:00+09:00`
  - Local time: `2024-01-15T14:30:00`

### Intention Enhancements

- **`rei intention tree`** — New filtering options:
  - `--future` — Show future intentions with parent chains
  - `--all` — Show both active and future intentions
  - `--completed` — Show completed intentions with parent chains
- **`rei intention show --full`** — Now displays "Supports" and "Supported By" sections

### FZF Enhancements

- **Interactive Toggle** — Press `ctrl-f` in FZF pickers to toggle between active-only and all intentions (active + future)

Output shows color-coded severity based on inactivity duration.

### Action Enhancements

- **`rei action update-occurred-at`** — Correct when an action occurred after recording
  - Supports relative time expressions (`2 hours ago`, `yesterday`, `-2h`)
  - FZF integration for selecting action and intention

### Habit Enhancements
