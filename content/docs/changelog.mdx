## 2026-02-12

### Feature Enhancements

- **`rei intention create --category`** — Assign a category at creation time instead of using a separate `set-category` command:
  ```bash
  rei intention create "Review Q1 goals" --category Work
  rei intention create "Plan health routine" --category "Personal/Health" --horizon 3m
  ```
- **`rei view edit`** — Edit a view's YAML configuration inline using `$EDITOR`. Opens a temporary file with the current config and applies changes on save:
  ```bash
  rei view edit daily-planning
  ```

---

## 2026-02-11

### New Command: Agent Assist

Start an interactive AI assistant for setup and management of your Rei system:

```bash
rei agent assist
```

Unlike other agent commands, assist is **always interactive** — it opens a Claude Code session pre-loaded with your complete Rei state. The assistant helps you organize, configure, and maintain your system.

### Filter Enhancements

- **Multiple `--where` filters** — Specify `--where` multiple times for AND logic on both `rei intention list` and `rei intention tree`:
  ```bash
  rei intention list --where priority=high --where "effort>=5"
  rei intention tree --where priority=high --where "effort>=5"
  ```
- **`key:missing` filter** — Filter to intentions that do not have a property set: `--where priority:missing`
- **LabelSet membership operators** — Filter by label-set membership with `any` (has any of) or `all` (has all of):
  ```bash
  rei intention list --where "tags any bug,feature"
  rei intention list --where "tags all urgent,blocking"
  ```

---

### New Feature: State Machine Required Property Rules

States can now require specific property values before allowing transitions. This enables checklist-gated workflows where prerequisites must be met before advancing:

```bash
# Require deploy-ready=true before entering production
rei custom-property add-state-rule workflow \
  --state production --require deploy-ready=true

# Remove a rule
rei custom-property remove-state-rule workflow \
  --state production --property deploy-ready
```

When adding a rule with a boolean value, if the referenced property doesn't exist, it is automatically created as a boolean property.

### New Feature: Task Completion Links

Boolean properties can be automatically set based on task completion in linked notes:

```bash
# Link note tasks to a boolean property
rei intention link-tasks -i <id> \
  --note <note-id> --property deploy-ready

# Remove the link
rei intention unlink-tasks -i <id> \
  --note <note-id> --property deploy-ready
```

When all tasks in the linked note are complete, the property is set to `true`. When any task is reopened, it reverts to `false`. Combined with state rules, this enables checklist-gated workflow transitions.

### Feature Enhancements

- **`rei intention show --full`** — Now displays category slug in intention details

---

## 2026-02-10

### New Feature: Note Value Type for Custom Properties

A new `note` value type allows creating custom properties that reference note entities:

```bash
rei custom-property create spec --type-note -e intention
```

Use note references to cross-link specs, next actions, or other structured note relationships on intentions.

### New Feature: View Property Display

View sections can now display custom properties inline under each entity:

```yaml
sections:
  - label: "Active Work"
    target: children
    showProperties: all              # Show all properties
  - label: "Priority View"
    target: children
    showProperties: [priority, status]  # Show specific properties
    excludeProperties: [internal_id]    # Exclude when using 'all'
```

Properties appear inline under each entity in view output.

### Feature Enhancements

- **`rei intention tree --where`** — Highlight intentions matching a property filter in the tree view. Matching intentions are displayed in bold, non-matching ones are dimmed.
- **`rei note list --include-descendants`** (`-d`) — When filtering by category, include notes from all descendant categories
- **`rei action list`** — FZF support for intention selection when `-i` is omitted

---

## 2026-02-08

### New Feature: Intention Views

Create reusable, multi-section views for displaying intentions and related entities:

```bash
# Create a view from YAML configuration
rei view create project-overview --from-file project.yaml

# Execute a view
rei view exec project-overview

# Execute a view scoped to an intention
rei view exec project-overview --scope int_01abc...

# Execute via intention command
rei intention view int_01abc... project-overview
```

**Key features:**
- Multi-section layouts (children + notes + tasks in one view)
- Grouping by custom properties (state machines, enums)
- Flexible filtering (status, dormancy, state tags, properties)
- Recursive queries on descendants at any depth

**View commands:**
- `rei view create` — Create a view from YAML
- `rei view list` — List all views
- `rei view show` — Show view definition
- `rei view exec` — Execute a view
- `rei view update` — Update from YAML
- `rei view export` — Export to YAML
- `rei view archive` / `restore` — Archive management

See [`rei view`](/docs/commands/view) and the [Views Guide](/docs/guides/views) for complete documentation.

## 2026-02-07

### New Command: Background Workers

Run background job workers that process messages from PGMQ queues:

```bash
# Run all workers (recommended for production)
rei worker all

# Run only the git sync worker
rei worker git-sync
```

Workers handle:
- `workspace-git-sync` — Commits note files to git with batching and deduplication
- `intention-dormancy` — Evaluates dormancy for intentions (triggered by pg_cron)
- `reminder-trigger` — Triggers due reminders (triggered by pg_cron)

See [`rei worker`](/docs/commands/worker) for full documentation.

### New Command: Periodic Checks

Manage automated periodic checks scheduled via pg_cron:

```bash
# Manually trigger dormancy evaluation
rei periodic-check enqueue dormancy

# Trigger reminder check
rei periodic-check enqueue reminder

# View pg_cron job status
rei periodic-check status

# View execution history
rei periodic-check history
```

Periodic checks automate:
- **Dormancy evaluation** — Marks inactive intentions as dormant (daily at 7 AM)
- **Reminder triggering** — Triggers due reminders (every 5 minutes)

See [`rei periodic-check`](/docs/commands/periodic-check) for full documentation.

## 2026-02-06

### New Feature: LabelSet Property Type

Multi-select labels for tagging with multiple values:

```bash
# Create a label-set property
rei custom-property create areas --type-label-set --labels backend,frontend,mobile,infra -e intention

# Assign multiple labels
rei intention set-property areas backend,frontend

# Add or remove individual labels
rei intention add-property-label areas security
rei intention remove-property-label areas mobile
```

**LabelSet Filtering:**

Filter using `any` (has any of) or `all` (has all of) operators:

```bash
rei intention list --where "areas any backend,frontend"  # Has backend OR frontend
rei intention list --where "areas all backend,security"  # Has BOTH backend AND security
```

### New Feature: Action List Command

View recorded actions with date range filtering:

```bash
rei action list              # Today's actions (default)
rei action list --week       # Last 7 days
rei action list --month      # Last 30 days
rei action list --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-01-31  # Custom range
rei action list -i intention_01abc...  # Filter by intention
rei action list --format json  # JSON output
```

### New Feature: Habit Blockers

Blockers can now be declared on habits with automatic pause/resume:

```bash
# Declare a blocker (auto-pauses the habit)
rei blocker declare --habit habit_01abc... "Gym closed for renovation"

# Resolve the blocker (auto-resumes if last blocker)
rei blocker resolve --habit habit_01abc... blocker_01xyz...

# List habit blockers
rei blocker list --habits
```

### New Feature: Actor Attribution

All write commands now support `--actor` for tracking who performed an action:

```bash
rei action record "Fixed bug" --actor claude-code
rei intention create "New project" --actor user
rei note new --actor claude-code
```

Useful for tracking changes made by different tools or users.

### Dashboard Context Filtering

Dashboard panels now respond to `--context` flag:

- Panels with explicit context that doesn't match are hidden
- Panels without explicit context filter to the CLI context
- Category-scoped panels are further filtered by context

---

## 2026-02-04

### New Guide: Dashboard Panels

Added comprehensive **[Dashboard Panels Guide](/docs/guides/dashboard)** covering:

- Panel configuration in `rei.yaml`
- Filter expressions (`where`, `state_tag`, `group_by`, `context`, `category`)
- State tag filtering for cross-property queries
- Grouping behavior and sort order
- Combining options with AND logic

Access the help topic with `rei help dashboard`.

### New Feature: Command Aliases

Define short command aliases in your config file for frequently used commands:

```bash
# In rei.yaml:
aliases:
  tw: today -c work --no-intentions
  ls: intention list --active
```

`rei tw` expands to `rei today -c work --no-intentions`. Additional arguments are appended.

List configured aliases with `rei alias list`.

### New Feature: Dashboard Panels

Configure custom intention query panels that appear at the end of the `rei today` output:

```yaml
dashboard:
  panels:
    - label: "Kanban Board"
      where: "workflow:exists"
      group_by: "workflow"
    - label: "Queue"
      state_tag: "queue"
```

Each panel supports property filters, state tag filters, grouping, and context/category scoping.

### Feature Enhancement: `--no-intentions` Flag

- **`rei today --no-intentions`** — Hide the active intentions and completed today sections from the dashboard output

### Dashboard Enhancements

- **`rei today`** — Now shows Flexible Habits section with progress tracking for FreeWeekly, FreeMonthly, FreeQuarterly, and FreeYearly habits
- **`rei tomorrow`** — Now shows Flexible Habits section with period progress
- **`rei yesterday`** — Now shows Flexible Habits section with completion status

---

## 2026-02-02

### New Guide: State Machine Properties

Added comprehensive **[State Machine Properties Guide](/docs/guides/state-machines)** covering:

- State machine creation and YAML configuration
- State tags (queue, active, done, terminal) for semantic filtering
- Transition enforcement between states
- WIP limits for managing work in progress
- Category-scoped state machines with automatic resolution
- Metrics and transition history

Access the help topic with `rei help state-machines`.

### New Feature: Category-Scoped Property Keys

The same property key can now exist in different categories with different configurations:

```bash
# Create different workflows for different categories
rei custom-property create workflow --from-file work.yaml -c work
rei custom-property create workflow --from-file personal.yaml -c personal
```

Entity assignment automatically resolves based on category. Use `--category` to disambiguate:

```bash
rei custom-property show workflow --category work
rei custom-property metrics workflow --category personal
```

### New Feature: WIP Limits

State machine states now support advisory WIP (Work In Progress) limits:

```bash
# Set a limit on a state
rei custom-property set-state-limit workflow --state in-progress --limit 3

# Clear a limit
rei custom-property clear-state-limit workflow --state in-progress

# View counts and limit status
rei custom-property show workflow --with-counts
```

Output shows when states exceed their limits:

```
in-progress - In Progress (limit: 3) [count: 4] OVER LIMIT
backlog - Backlog [count: 5]
done - Done [count: 12]
```

### Custom Properties Guide Enhancements

The **[Custom Properties Guide](/docs/guides/custom-properties)** now includes:

- Category-scoped keys section with resolution behavior
- WIP limits section with commands and output examples
- Complete command summary tables for property, enum, and state machine operations

---

## 2026-02-01

### New Feature: Tree TUI Fuzzy Filtering

Press `/` in `rei intention tree --tui` to enter filter mode:

- Type any characters to fuzzy-match against intention titles
- Non-contiguous matches work (e.g., "abc" matches "Add blocker component")
- Matched characters highlighted in yellow
- Match count shows as `(3/15)` in the filter bar
- Navigate with `j`/`k` while filtering
- Press `Esc` to clear filter

### New Feature: Property Existence Filter

Filter intentions by whether they have a property set:

```bash
rei intention list --where "priority:exists"
rei intention list --where "workflow:exists"
```

### Custom Property Enhancements

- **`rei custom-property relabel`** — Renamed from `rename` for clarity
- **`rei custom-property add-state --order`** — Set display order when adding states
- **`rei custom-property update-state-order`** — Update display order for existing states
- **`rei custom-property init-entities`** — Retroactively initialize state machine properties for entities with matching categories

### Automatic State Machine Initialization

State machine properties scoped to a category are now automatically initialized when a category is assigned to an entity. Use `init-entities` to retroactively initialize existing entities.

---

### New Feature: Intention Grouping

Group intention list output by custom property values:

```bash
rei intention list --group-by priority
rei intention list --group-by workflow
rei intention list --context work --group-by priority
rei intention list --where "effort>=3" --group-by priority
```

Intentions are organized into groups by their property value, with counts shown for each group. Group sorting order:

- **State machine properties**: sorted by `stateOrder` (ascending), then alphabetically
- **Numeric properties**: sorted descending (highest values first)
- **Text/enum properties**: sorted alphabetically ascending
- **"(none)" group**: always last (intentions without the property)

Grouping only works with `--format default` and can be combined with all other filters.

### New Guide: Custom Properties

Added comprehensive **[Custom Properties Guide](/docs/guides/custom-properties)** covering property types, state machines, filtering, and best practices.

### New Guide: Time Formats

Added **[Time Formats Guide](/docs/guides/time-formats)** documenting relative and absolute time formats for the `--at` flag.

---

## 2026-02-01 (Earlier)

### New Command: Yesterday Dashboard

Quick review of the previous day's activity:

- `rei yesterday` — Review yesterday's activity and accomplishments
- `rei yesterday --context work` — Filter to a specific context

The yesterday dashboard shows:
- Cycle context (if yesterday was part of an active cycle)
- Completed intentions
- Actions taken with timestamps, durations, and notes
- Outcomes recorded
- Habits scheduled with completion status
- Reflections performed

### New Command: Review Day

Review any arbitrary date with the new `day` subcommand:

- `rei review day` — Review yesterday (same data as `rei yesterday`)
- `rei review day 2025-01-15` — Review a specific date
- `rei review day --date 2025-01-15 -c work` — Combine date and context filter

Use `rei yesterday` for quick access to the previous day, or `rei review day [DATE]` when you need to review a specific date.

### New Commands: Intention Detach and Note List

Manage intention hierarchy and notes:

- `rei intention detach` — Detach an intention from its parent, making it a root intention
- `rei intention note list` — List notes attached to an intention (including notes on actions, outcomes, and reflections)
- `rei intention note list --recursive` — Include notes from all descendant intentions
- `rei intention note list --json` — Output as JSON for scripting

---

## 2026-01-31

### New Feature: State Tag Filtering

Filter intentions across all state machine properties by system tag:

```bash
rei intention list --state-tag queue      # Items waiting to be worked on
rei intention list --state-tag active     # Items currently in progress
rei intention list --state-tag done       # Completed items
rei intention list --state-tag terminal   # Items in final states
```

This is useful for cross-property queries when you have multiple state machine properties (like `task-status` or `review-status`) and want to find all items in a particular state category without knowing which specific property or state value to query.

### New Feature: Category Filter for Intentions

Filter intentions by category slug:

```bash
rei intention list --category projects
rei intention list --category projects --future
rei intention list --category personal/health
```

### New Help Topic: Intention Filtering

**Property types:** int, float, text, bool, enum, duration, quantity, state-machine, date, datetime, path, url

**State machine properties** support workflows with defined states and transitions:
- Configure via YAML file with `--type-state-machine --from-file workflow.yaml`
- Evolve state machines with `add-state`, `remove-state`, `add-transition`, `remove-transition`
- Use system tags (TagQueue, TagActive, TagDone, TagTerminal) for semantic meaning

### Using Properties on Entities

Assign property values to entities:

- `rei intention set-property priority high` — Set property on an intention
- `rei habit set-property effort 5` — Set property on a habit
- `rei disruption set-property severity critical` — Set property on a disruption
- `rei intention clear-property priority` — Remove a property value

### Filtering by Properties

Filter entity lists using the new `--where` flag:

- `rei intention list --where priority=high` — Filter by exact match
- `rei intention list --where "effort>=5"` — Filter by numeric comparison
- `rei habit list --where "effort<3"` — Works on habits too
- `rei disruption list --where severity=critical` — And disruptions

### New Commands: Habit Categories

Habits can now be categorized:

- `rei habit set-category habit_01abc... health` — Assign category
- `rei habit clear-category habit_01abc...` — Remove category

- `rei task abandon task_01abc... --at yesterday` — Backdate abandonment

**Task lifecycle:**
- Tasks have three statuses: **Pending** `[ ]`, **Completed** `[x]`, **Abandoned** `[-]`
- Use `rei task reopen` to return either Completed or Abandoned tasks to Pending

**Cascade abandonment:**
When you abandon an intention via `rei intention abandon`, all of its pending tasks are automatically abandoned with the reason "Parent intention abandoned".

**Listing abandoned tasks:**
- `rei task list --all --abandoned-only` — Show only abandoned tasks
- `rei task list --all --include-abandoned` — Include abandoned in listings

### New Command: Category Set-Description

### New Command: Help Topics

Display detailed help on specific Rei concepts and features:

- `rei help` — List all available help topics
- `rei help time` — Learn about time formats and the `--at` flag

For command-specific help, continue using `rei <command> --help`.

### New Feature: Agent Debug Mode

All agent commands now support `--debug` to see the rendered prompt without invoking the LLM:

```bash
rei agent --debug coach
rei agent --debug review intention_01abc...
rei agent --debug reflect today
```

This is useful for testing prompt construction and debugging context loading.

### New Feature: Category Note Guidance

Categories can now have note guidance that automatically applies when using `rei note get-help` on notes in that category:

- `rei category set-note-guidance learning/japanese -c "Focus on stroke order"` — Set guidance
- `rei category clear-note-guidance learning/japanese` — Remove guidance

Category guidance provides domain knowledge (e.g., "how to study kanji") that composes with intention-level guidance when both are present.

### New Feature: Dormancy Reminders

When an intention becomes dormant (inactive for 30+ days), Rei now automatically creates a reminder to prompt you to revisit it. Dormancy reminders are:
- Scheduled 21 days after the intention becomes dormant
- Automatically cancelled when the intention awakens
- Automatically completed when the intention reaches a terminal state

View system reminders with `rei reminder list --system`.

### New Feature: Note Guidance for Intentions

Set AI guidance that automatically applies when getting help with any note under an intention:

- `rei intention set-note-guidance` — Set guidance via editor, inline, or stdin
- `rei intention show-note-guidance` — View current guidance

### New Command: Categories

Categories provide a flexible way to classify and organize your actions, notes, and intentions. Unlike contexts (which group root intentions by life domain), categories form a hierarchical tree that can be applied to any entity.

**Core commands:**

- `rei category create` — Create a new category with optional parent and description
- `rei category list` — List categories (hierarchical by default, or flat)
- `rei category tree` — View category hierarchy as a tree
- `rei category show` — Show details of a specific category
- `rei category retire` — Soft-delete a category (preserved for historical data)
- `rei category reactivate` — Bring back a retired category
- `rei category link-focus` — Link a category to a focus area for time tracking

**Hierarchical slugs:**

Categories support parent-child relationships. The slug is automatically computed:

```bash
rei category create "Work" -d "Work activities"        # slug: work
rei category create "Meeting" -p work                   # slug: work/meeting
rei category create "1-on-1" -p work/meeting           # slug: work/meeting/1-on-1
```

**Category assignment:**

Assign categories to entities for classification:

- `rei action set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize actions
- `rei note set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize notes
- `rei intention set-category` / `clear-category` — Categorize intentions

Categories can be linked to focus areas to enable category-based time tracking and reporting.

Interactive mode starts Claude Code with your Rei state pre-loaded. Claude can record actions, resolve blockers, and make changes on your behalf — all `rei` commands are pre-approved, so you won't see permission prompts.

### New Feature: Habit Polarity (Build vs Break)

Habits now support two polarities:

- **Build habits** (default) — Practices you want to cultivate and perform regularly
- **Break habits** — Behaviors you want to avoid or reduce

Create Break habits with the `--break` flag:

```bash
rei habit create \
  --name "Avoid Late-Night Snacking" \
  --purpose "Improve sleep and health" \
  --daily \
  --break
```

Break habits support abstinence tracking:

- `rei habit start-abstinence` — Start tracking how long you've avoided the behavior
- `rei habit log-occurrence` — Log when the behavior occurred (resets tracking)

### New Feature: Expanded Habit Cadences

Habits now support many more scheduling options beyond daily and weekly:

**Fixed schedules:**

- `--free-yearly <count>` — At least N times per year

**Cue-based:**
- `--cue <description>` — Triggered by a specific context (e.g., "After meals")
- `--target <frequency>` — Optional frequency goal (e.g., "3/week")

### Action Enhancements

- **`rei action reassociate`** — Move an action from one intention to another. Useful when you accidentally recorded an action against the wrong intention. Historical data is preserved.

Designate a note as the overview for an intention to provide context and serve as an entry point:

- `rei intention set-overview` — Designate a note as the overview for an intention
- `rei intention clear-overview` — Remove the overview designation

Overview notes appear prominently in `rei intention show --full` output, making it easy to capture and surface important context about your intentions.
