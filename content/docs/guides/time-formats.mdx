Rei uses relative and absolute time formats for the `--at` flag, allowing you to record events that happened in the past.

## Relative Time

Use natural language to specify times relative to now:

```bash
"2 hours ago"       # Two hours before now
"1 hour ago"        # One hour before now
"30 minutes ago"    # Thirty minutes before now
"yesterday"         # Yesterday at current time
"3 days ago"        # Three days before now
```

## Absolute Time

Specify exact dates and times:

```bash
"2024-01-15"        # Specific date at current time
"2024-01-15 14:30"  # Specific date and time
"14:30"             # Today at specific time
```

## Examples

### Recording Completed Actions

```bash
# Complete an action 2 hours ago
rei action complete --at "2 hours ago"

# Start an action at a specific time today
rei action start --at "14:30"
```

### Logging Habits

```bash
# Log a habit for yesterday
rei habit log --at yesterday
```

### Completing Tasks

```bash
# Complete a task at a specific date and time
rei task complete --at "2024-01-15 09:00"
```

### Starting Focus Cycles

```bash
# Start a focus cycle 30 minutes ago
rei cycle start --at "30 minutes ago"
```
