Intention views provide reusable, multi-section configurations for displaying intentions and related entities. Each view defines sections that query children, descendants, notes, tasks, or actions with optional filtering, grouping, and ordering.

## Overview

Views are first-class entities that define how to display intention data. Unlike the fixed `--full` display, views let you configure exactly what data to show and how to organize it.

**Key features:**
- Multi-section layouts (e.g., children + notes + tasks in one view)
- Grouping by custom properties (state machines, enums, etc.)
- Recursive queries on descendants at any depth
- Configurable metadata display per section
- Reusable across different intentions

**Example workflow:**
1. Create a view from a YAML file
2. Execute the view on any intention
3. See organized, grouped output

## Creating Views

Create from a YAML file:

```bash
rei view create project-overview --from-file project.yaml
```

Create with description:

```bash
rei view create daily-planning \
  --from-file daily.yaml \
  -d "Daily planning dashboard"
```

## YAML Configuration

Views are defined using YAML files with sections:

```yaml
sections:
  - label: "Active Children"
    target: children
    filters:
      - type: status
        value: active
    groupBy: priority
    orderBy: created_at
    limit: 10
    hideIfEmpty: true

  - label: "Recent Notes"
    target: notes
    limit: 5

showDormant: false
```

## Section Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `label` | string | Required. Display name for the section header |
| `target` | string | Required. What to query (see Target Types below) |
| `filters` | array | Optional. Array of filter conditions |
| `groupBy` | string | Optional. Property key to group results by |
| `orderBy` | string | Optional. Field to order by: `created_at`, `title`, `deadline`, `active_days` |
| `limit` | integer | Optional. Maximum number of results in this section |
| `hideIfEmpty` | boolean | Optional. If true, hides section when no results |

### Target Types

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `self` | The scoped intention itself |
| `children` | Direct children only |
| `descendants` | All descendants at any depth |
| `descendants:N` | Descendants up to depth N |
| `notes` | Notes on the scope intention |
| `tasks` | Tasks under the scope |
| `actions` | Actions recorded on the scope |

### Grouping

When `groupBy` is set, results are organized under sub-headers by property value. Groups follow property order (state machine `stateOrder` for state machines).

## Filters

### Status Filter

Filter by intention status:

```yaml
- type: status
  value: active    # active, future, completed, abandoned
```

### Dormancy Filter

Control dormant intention inclusion:

```yaml
- type: dormancy
  value: exclude   # include, exclude, only
```

### State Tag Filter

Filter by state machine system tag:

```yaml
- type: state_tag
  property: workflow
  tag: active      # queue, active, done, terminal
```

### Property Filter

Filter by custom property value:

```yaml
- type: property
  property: priority
  operator: eq     # exists, not_exists, eq, neq, contains
  value: high
```

**Property filter operators:**

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `exists` | Property exists |
| `not_exists` | Property does not exist |
| `eq` | Equals value |
| `neq` | Not equals value |
| `contains` | Contains text |

## Executing Views

Execute a view (global scope):

```bash
rei view exec my-view
```

Execute scoped to an intention:

```bash
rei view exec project-overview --scope int_01abc...
```

Execute via intention command (FZF selection):

```bash
rei intention view
```

Execute with explicit IDs:

```bash
rei intention view int_01abc... project-overview
```

## Managing Views

List all views:

```bash
rei view list
```

Include archived views:

```bash
rei view list --include-archived
```

Show view definition:

```bash
rei view show my-view
```

Update from YAML file:

```bash
rei view update my-view --from-file updated.yaml
```

Export view to YAML:

```bash
rei view export my-view > my-view.yaml
```

Archive a view:

```bash
rei view archive old-view
```

Restore archived view:

```bash
rei view restore old-view
```

## Example: Daily Planning View

```yaml
sections:
  - label: "Today's Focus"
    target: children
    filters:
      - type: status
        value: active
      - type: dormancy
        value: exclude
    orderBy: created_at
    limit: 5

  - label: "Blocked"
    target: descendants
    filters:
      - type: state_tag
        property: workflow
        tag: blocked
    hideIfEmpty: true

  - label: "Upcoming"
    target: children
    filters:
      - type: status
        value: future
    limit: 3

showDormant: false
```

## Example: Project Review View

```yaml
sections:
  - label: "Project Overview"
    target: self

  - label: "Active Work"
    target: children
    filters:
      - type: status
        value: active
    groupBy: version-phase

  - label: "Recent Notes"
    target: notes
    limit: 10

showDormant: false
```

## Example: Kanban Board View

```yaml
sections:
  - label: "Work Items"
    target: descendants:2
    filters:
      - type: property
        property: workflow
        operator: exists
    groupBy: workflow

showDormant: false
```

## Output

View output shows sections with optional grouping:

```
View: project-overview
  Project planning dashboard

## Active Children (5)

  [*] Implement user auth (int_01ab...)
  [*] Review documentation (int_01cd...)
  [*] Fix database migration (int_01ef...)

## Blocked (grouped by workflow)

  ### blocked (1)
    [*] Deploy to staging (int_01gh...)

## Recent Notes

  (notes listed here)
```

## View Names

View names must be:
- Unique (case-insensitive)
- Valid identifiers (lowercase, hyphens/underscores, no spaces)

Examples: `daily-planning`, `project_review`, `quarterly-okrs`
