Dashboard panels are configurable intention views that appear in the `rei today` command output. Define panels in your `rei.yaml` config file to create custom filtered and grouped views of your intentions.

## Configuration

Add a `dashboard.panels` section to your `rei.yaml` config file:

```yaml title="rei.yaml"
dashboard:
  panels:
    - label: "By Version Phase"
      where: "version-phase:exists"
      group_by: "version-phase"

    - label: "In Development"
      where: "version-phase=development"
      context: "work"

    - label: "Active Projects"
      state_tag: "active"
      category: "projects"
      group_by: "version-phase"
```

Panels appear at the end of the `rei today` command output after the standard dashboard sections.

## Panel Options

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `label` | Yes | Display name shown as the panel header |
| `where` | No | Property filter expression (same syntax as `intention list --where`) |
| `state_tag` | No | Filter by state machine system tag: `queue`, `active`, `done`, `terminal` |
| `group_by` | No | Property key to group results by (sorted by state machine order when applicable) |
| `context` | No | Limit to intentions within this context (cannot combine with `category`) |
| `category` | No | Limit to intentions within this category slug (cannot combine with `context`) |

## Filter Expressions

The `where` field accepts the same syntax as the `--where` flag on `intention list`:

**Exact match:**
```yaml
where: "priority=high"
```

**Existence check:**
```yaml
where: "effort:exists"
```

**Numeric comparison:**
```yaml
where: "effort>=5"
where: "complexity<3"
```

**State machine tag query:**
```yaml
where: "workflow:queue=backlog"
```

**Operators:** `=` (equals), `>` (greater), `>=` (greater or equal), `<` (less), `<=` (less or equal), `:exists` (has any value)

For full filter syntax details, see the [Intention Filtering Guide](/docs/guides/intention-filtering).

## State Tag Filter

The `state_tag` field matches intentions that have any state machine property whose current state carries the specified system tag:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `queue` | Items waiting to start |
| `active` | Items in progress |
| `done` | Completed items |
| `terminal` | Items in final states |

For more on state tags, see the [State Machine Properties Guide](/docs/guides/state-machines).

## Grouping

When `group_by` is set, intentions are organized under sub-headers by their property value. Sorting follows the same rules as `intention list`:

- **State machine properties** — by stateOrder (ascending)
- **Other properties** — alphabetically
- **"(none)" group** — always last

## Combining Options

All panel options combine with AND logic. A panel with both `where` and `state_tag` will only show intentions matching both conditions:

```yaml
- label: "High Priority Active Work"
  where: "priority=high"
  state_tag: "active"
  context: "work"
```

## Examples

**Track a kanban board across all intentions:**

```yaml
- label: "Kanban Board"
  where: "workflow:exists"
  group_by: "workflow"
```

**Show only blocked items:**

```yaml
- label: "Blocked Items"
  where: "workflow=blocked"
```

**Weekly review of personal projects:**

```yaml
- label: "Personal Projects"
  category: "personal"
  group_by: "priority"
```

**Items in the queue that need attention:**

```yaml
- label: "Queue"
  state_tag: "queue"
```

## Context Filtering

When the `rei today` command is run with `--context`, panels are filtered:

- Panels with an explicit context that does not match are hidden entirely
- Panels with no explicit context have the CLI context applied as a filter, showing only intentions belonging to that context
- Panels with a category scope are additionally filtered by the CLI context, showing only intentions in both the category and the context

**Example:**

```bash
rei today --context work
```

With this config:

```yaml title="rei.yaml"
dashboard:
  panels:
    - label: "All Active"           # Filtered to work intentions
    - label: "Work Board"           # Shown (context matches)
      context: "work"
    - label: "Personal Board"       # Hidden (context mismatch)
      context: "personal"
    - label: "Active Projects"      # Filtered to work + projects
      category: "projects"
```

## Behavior

- Panels only appear when configured (empty default)
- Invalid filter expressions are silently skipped
- Category slugs that don't exist produce no results
- Panels with no matching intentions show "No matching intentions"
- Each panel runs an independent query against the read model
