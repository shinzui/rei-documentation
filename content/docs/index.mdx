# rei (怜)

Personal time-management, prioritization, and agent-assisted coaching system built around *intentional action over time*.

The name comes from Japanese kanji (怜) meaning "perceptive, wise, emotionally aware" — emphasizing clear perception of reality rather than brute control.

**Rei is not about doing more; it's about seeing better and acting with clarity.**

## Philosophy

Rei replaces ad-hoc productivity tools by combining:

- A **CLI-first interface** for fast capture and review
- An **append-only event log** as the source of truth
- **Read models** for fast queries and analysis
- A **filesystem-backed knowledge system** (notes, docs, links)
- **AI agents** that provide coaching without mutating state

## Core Principles

1. **Event-sourced truth** — state is derived, never mutated directly
2. **Intention-centered** — organize work by meaning, not checklists
3. **Evidence-based review** — outcomes + reflections beat memory
4. **Local-first & transparent** — files are yours; nothing is hidden
5. **Agent coaching without magic** — agents nudge based on facts

## Nine Primitives

Everything in rei is built from nine composable primitives:

| Primitive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intention** | A commitment to a change in the world (not just a task) |
| **Action** | The concrete work you do |
| **Outcome** | Observable evidence that something changed |
| **Blocker** | What prevents the next meaningful action |
| **Dependency** | Another intention that constrains this one |
| **Habit** | A recurring activity with lifecycle management |
| **Reflection** | Deliberate interpretation of past work over time |
| **Focus** | A category of activity for daily time allocation |
| **Cycle** | A bounded time period for tracking daily focus selections |
